# ThreeFold Global Grid FAQ

## Grid

### Why do we need a new, neutral “Edge” Internet Grid

The Internet has a USD Trillion problem. Today demand for Internet capacity is far outstripping the available infrastructure due to new applications like Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence.

The existing hyperscale cloud infrastructure cannot cope with this outsize demand as the requirements for land, power and funding are just too great. We (and most other experts) believe the solution to these $trillion problems is migration of IT capacity to the Edge - ie a “hyper-distributed” network infrastructure.

For more on this see [“Why do we need a new Internet” blog post](../information/the-need-for-a-new-neutral-edge-internet), you can also find some more info in our [PTO whitepaper](http://tiny.cc/tf_whitepaper_pto)

### What is our global Grid (the Grid.TF)?

Our global grid or Grid.Tf is the network of all the distributed infrastructure and capacity that is available for sale via our Directory (for Tokens).

See bottomn of home page, which shows how much capacity is available.

### How is our Grid different from existing IT infrastructure?

We have a hyper-distributed Edge network - meaning that our nodes are located close to users. Our network is very neutral, green and very secure.

This is very different from the majority of Internet infrastructure which is centralised in large $ billion datacenters (owned by a handful of large tech companies).

For more on this see [“Why do we need a new Internet” blog post](../information/the-need-for-a-new-neutral-edge-internet).


### What is our Directory service?

Our Directory service is a global directory service running on top of our blockchain that publishes all available capacity, services and pricing on our Global Grid. Our Directory is integrated with ItsYou.Online for authentication of all users and members.

### When will I be able to use the Grid and Directory Service?

Our Grid is already up and running. At the time of our Public Token Offering more than 200 Hosters and Operators are members - operating their own infrastructure and generating capacity. All available capacity on the Grid is registered for sale via our Directory service. All purchases are made with Tokens.

Untill the end of your only people who help us to expand the grid will be allowed to use the grid's capacity.

### What is a Zero Node?

A Zero Node is a pre-fabricated Node using our Zero OS that can be connected to the Internet and power and start generating capacity on our Grid. Zero Nodes are self driving so even non-technical people can invest in a Zero Node and start selling capacity to earn Tokens.

### What do we mean when we say we enable “Uber for IT”?

When we say “Uber for IT” we mean that we enable our Hosters to deploy their own IT infrastructure from their home or other location and sell compute and storage capacity Peer2Peer on our Grid. Any Token Holder can invest in a Zero Node, connect to the Internet and automatically start selling capacity for Tokens. It’s like Uber with self driving cars.

## Directory

### What is the ThreeFold Directory?

Our Directory is a global directory service running on top of our blockchain that publishes all available capacity, services and pricing on our Global Grid.  

Our Directory is integrated with ItsYou.Online for authentication of all users and members.


### What is the value of our Directory for Hosters and Operators?

Hosters and Operators who generate IT capacity on their own infrastructure can make their capacity available for sale on our global Directory.  The capacity is automatically posted on the Directory and pricing is determined by our algorithm (see below).  

With the Directory, Hosters can be self driving - so there is no need for you to create and host your own commercial internet presence.

### How can a Hoster or Operator sign up to our Directory?

You simply sign in via your ItsYou.Online credentials you created when you signed up as a Hoster or Operator. After you signed in you click on your 0-Node GUI and select the IT capacity you want to sell on the TF Directory.  

The process from that point is automated / self-driving.

###  How is the IT capacity price set on the Directory?

The pricing is determined by our algorithm which factors in real time supply and demand and local market factors - as well as the location and environment of the Hoster.  More advanced Hosters can also customise pricing if desired. 

### Are there products other than IT capacity being offered at our Directory?

In addition to basic IT capacity, the Directory also has API-based services and applications created by Service Providers based on our TF Service App.  
 
## How is IT capacity sale be transacted?

Once a Hoster or Operator is registered on our Directory, the available capacity becomes visible to Users and Service Providers. Transactions are API-driven based on smart contracts. The smart contract specifies the key information such as the capacity or service, duration, price per unit, location, etc.  All transactions on the Directory are executed using TF Tokens.  The Tokens are automatically deposited in the Hoster’s or Operator’s e-Wallet.
