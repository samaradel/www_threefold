# Why THREEFOLD Token

## Why should I buy Tokens?

The reasons for investors to buy Tokens in the private token offering include the following:

* Good cause:  purchasers are helping us build a new neutral edge Internet
* Potential upside: ThreeFold sits at the intersection of three of today’s most important technologies - Blockchain, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence, and we believe that as our global Grid expands and the capacity available for sale grows, the demand for our Tokens will increas
* Downside Protection and reduced volatility (ie Token price less likely to decrease substantially):  Our Tokens are backed by the grid deployed by the Foundation.  Our Technology and Grid are already up and running and we believe our Foundation and its assets represent significant value, including sufficient liquidity
* High quality team with extensive technology and financial experience
* Existing technology that is very well positioned for Edge networking and outperforms  leading technologies in many categories

## Why do we need a ThreeFold Token?

Decentralized digital currencies are well on the way to full acceptance as a mainstream currency in the future.  Benefits include direct peer to peer transactions (requiring no intermediaries such as banks); greater trust (secured by cryptography and mathematics); lower friction charges; faster transaction times and no single point of failure.

Major problems remain, however, such as scalability issues, impossible energy requirements, certain perceived reputational issues and, most importantly, a general absence of intrinsic value collateralized by real assets.

We designed our Token as a safe, scalable currency with real utility and intrinsic value backed by real assets.

## What are the Foundation’s objectives for the TF Token?

The Foundation’s long term objective is to migrate the TF Token firmly into the mainstream as a payment instrument used to purchase IT and other services. We seek  to:

* Create a safe, alternative currency with intrinsic value backed by real assets
* Give our Tokens a designated utility by linking the  Token directly to the growth of the Internet
* Support our Tokens - prioritise liquidity, stability, transparency and exchangeability for Token Holders
* Ensure the integrity and security of the Tokens for Token Holders

## Why did we use the word Token vs Coin?

We use the word “Token” because our Tokens are much more than a simple coin.  In our view, coins really only have one function:  to act as simple stores of value.  Our Tokens represent an  economic interest in our Foundation and is the exclusive payment instrument or currency for which operators can sell IT capacity via our Directory service.

## Is our Token different from other digital currencies.

We designed our Token to be different from other Tokens in several respects including the following:
* Backed.  The Tokens are backed with full economic interests in the Foundation and the Foundation’s assets
* Utility.  From inception, our Tokens have a specific designated use as the payment currency for buying and selling IT capacity on our Grid.  
* Neutral.  Our Foundation is mission- and value-based, has no shareholders and is not owned or controlled by any institution or government.  
* Green.  Our blockchain is different - and enables much greater scalability to millions  of transactions without requiring outsize energy consumption
* Secure.  Also our blockchain is less vulnerable to large miner consortia controlling hashrates or DDOS and other attacks.  All users and nodes are registered on our blockchain-based identity management platform enhancing security and privacy.


## How is our Token “backed” by real assets?

By “backed”, we mean asset-backed. Each Token is collateralized by all of the Foundation’s assets.  The Foundation’s funds and cash flows are invested into revenue-generating assets that grow organically - creating additional value for Token Holders.

## Why do we say our Token has “utility” and why is this important?

When we talk about “utility”, we mean that our Token has a designated “use” as the exclusive payment currency for buying and selling Internet capacity via our Directory on our Grid.  
This utility is important because it generates additional demand, diversification, volumes and liquidity for Token Holders.  This is an important differentiator for our Token - as digital currencies today generally have limited utility.

# PTO = Private Token Offering

[Read more about our PTO here](/pto).


## Why do we use the term PTO (unlike ICO)

We refer to our token sale as a private token offering (PTO) instead of an initial coin offering (ICO).

We believe our token offering is different from some of the other ICOs.  We are already up and running - our technology is fully developed (>10 years) and our Grid is already operational prior to the PTO.

## Where can I buy a Token?

ThreeFold Tokens will be available for sale directly on our website during the PTO.

One needs only sign up with our [ItsYou.Online](http://itsyou.online) identity management platform and open their e-Wallet on our App.

As payment, we accept  BTC, ETH, USD, GBP, CHF, EUR, YEN, AED and other methods available on exchanges.

## How many tokens already exists?

Today there are 10,000,000 Tokens created and backed by the value of our Foundation and by internet capacity which is committed to be deployed by our operators and hosters over more than 200 locations.

See bottom of our home page where you can see where existing capacity has been deployed.

## What is the Token Issuance Mechanism?

During the initial investment phase for our Grid through December 2019, we want to protect value for our Token Holders.  To do this we have created our Token Issuance Mechanism (the Mechanism) which protects the prescribes the Token price at which each tranche of Tokens shall be issued as follows:
* First 1 million shares at US$ 10 per Token
* Next 1 million shares at US$ 13 per Token
* Next 1 million shares at US$ 16 per Token
* Next 1 million shares at US$ 19 per Token
* Next 1 million shares at US$ 22 per Token
* Next 1 million shares at US$ 25 per Token
* Next 1 million shares at US$ 28 per Token
* Next 1 million shares at US$ 31 per Token

* Thereafter, the Token price will increase in increments of 10% for each block of 1 million Tokens that are issued and sold.

After December 2019, the Token price will trade based on market supply and demand.  An additional 1 million Tokens will be issued every time the Token price increases 10% from the Token price of the previous issuance.  For purposes of calculating this Token price threshold, the Foundation shall use the average Token price calculated over 5 consecutive trading days.  The resulting price for issuance of the 1 million new Tokens shall be equal to 10% above this 5 day average price. 

## Can the Token Issuance Mechanism be stopped? What is the process?

The Token Issuance Mechanism can be stopped if a vote of 60% of the Ambassador Board elects to stop it


## How will we create liquidity for Token Holders who wish to sell their Tokens?

To protect our Token Holders and ensure that our Token issuance mechanism does not soak up all of the demand in the market, we have introduced a liquidity mechanism for the initial period from the commencement of the Token offering until December 2019 whereby:

* Token Holders who have purchased Tokens in the Token offering have priority to sell their Tokens before any issuance of 
* Founders also have (pro rata) priority in the Queue - but only up to 20% of the Tokens they own that are available for sale.  To sell more than 20%, Founders must go to the back of the queue
* Only after all the sales from Token Holders are exhausted will the new Tokens be sold
* The price will not increase until the full 1 million newly issued Tokens are sold

The intention of the Foundation is that this system should enable sufficient liquidity for Token Holders who wish to sell Tokens during periods when the Foundation is issuing new Tokens

## Can Token holders just send Tokens to other users of the app? 
Yes.

## On what exchange will the Tokens be listed?

The Tokens will be tradable on the Foundation’s private exchange.

## When will the PTO be held.

The Private Token Offering will be done Q4 2017.

## More details about the PTO

[Read more about our PTO here](/pto).

## What will be my ROI if I buy token? What is your projection for the Token price?

During the PTO, we only sell tokens at ever increasing prices in batches of 1 million tokens. We make no other predictions or guarantees. However, thanks to the utility of our Tokens as designated payment currency for Internet capacity sold on our Grid, we believe our Tokens will be supported by additional demand, volume and diversification.  Also our Tokens are backed by the Foundation - and we expect the Foundation’s value to grow rapidly.

##  Can I buy Tokens with bank transfer?

Yes, you can buy Tokens with bank transfers. USD, GBP, EUR at first, adding YEN, and CHF at a later date.
We also allow BTC payments at first, adding ETH at a later date.

## Can I buy Tokens if I am in US or I am a US citizen?

No.

# Guarantees & Safety

## How does TF control the issuing of further tokens?

The Foundation may issue new Tokens via follow-on Token Offerings to make further investments in Internet capacity on our global Grid and will from time to time sell Tokens to purchasers of Grid internet capacity. These follow-on Token offerings will always be at a strictly higher price than the preceding offering.


## Can I reclaim assets owned by ThreeFold foundation?

No. Token Holders should not expect to profit from reclaiming assets or cash from the Foundation. Profits for Token Holders should come from selling the Tokens at a price that is higher than the price at which the Token was purchased.

## KYC and AML Procedures

We take our Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations seriously.  We employ robust onboarding protocols and identity management via itsyou.online.

## Will you have an escrow during the PTO?

No. We are already up and running and we invest the PTO proceeds in additional Internet capacity on our Grid.  We are not awaiting technology or other “development” milestones - so there is no need to have an escrow.

## How is the Foundation structured and where is it based?

See our [FOUNDATION FAQ](/faq/foundation-faq).

## How are the proceeds of the Tokens Used?

The Foundation will use the net proceeds of the PTO for working capital and to deploy additional Internet capacity on our global Grid.  Part of the proceeds of the PTO will be held as cash on balance sheet to support Token liquidity.

# Technical

## Which blockchain is used? What is the issuing format for the ThreeFold Token?

At the PTO, our Tokens will be issued on Ethereum blockchain as ERC20 compliant Tokens.  Over time we intend to migrate our Tokens to our own blockchain called Rivine.io.

## Where can I find the smart contract code?

The ThreeFold Token Smart Contract will be publicly available prior to the start of the PTO.
