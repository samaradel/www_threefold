# Why THREEFOLD Token

## Why should I buy Tokens?

The reasons for people to buy Tokens in the Public Token offering include the following:

* Good cause: purchasers are helping us build a new neutral edge Internet
* Potential upside: ThreeFold sits at the intersection of three of today’s most important technologies - Blockchain, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence, and we believe that as our global Grid expands and the capacity available for sale grows, the demand for our Tokens will increase.
* Downside Protection and reduced volatility (ie Token price less likely to decrease substantially):  Our Tokens are given utility by the grid deployed by the Foundation.  Our Technology and Grid are already up and running and we believe our Foundation and its assets represent significant value, including sufficient liquidity
* High quality team with extensive technology and financial experience
* Existing technology that is very well positioned for Edge networking and outperforms  leading technologies in many categories

## Why do we need a ThreeFold Token?

Decentralized digital currencies are well on the way to full acceptance as a mainstream currency in the future.  Benefits include direct peer to peer transactions (requiring no intermediaries such as banks); greater trust (secured by cryptography and mathematics); lower friction charges; faster transaction times and no single point of failure.

Major problems remain, however, such as scalability issues, impossible energy requirements, certain perceived reputational issues and, most importantly, a general absence of intrinsic value collateralized by real assets.

We designed our Token as a safe, scalable currency with real utility and intrinsic value rooted in real assets.

## What are the Foundation’s objectives for the TF Token?

The Foundation’s long term objective is to migrate the TF Token firmly into the mainstream as a payment instrument used to purchase IT and other services. We seek  to:

* Create a safe, alternative currency with intrinsic value rooted in real assets
* Give our Tokens a designated utility by linking the  Token directly to the growth of the Internet
* Support our Tokens - prioritise liquidity, stability, transparency and exchangeability for Token Holders
* Ensure the integrity and security of the Tokens for Token Holders

## Why did we use the word Token vs Coin?

We use the word “Token” because our Tokens are much more than a simple coin.  In our view, coins really only have one function:  to act as simple stores of value.  Our Tokens represent an  economic interest in our Foundation and is the exclusive payment instrument or currency for which operators can sell Internet IT capacity via our Directory service.

## Is our Token different from other digital currencies?

We designed our Token to be different from other Tokens in several respects including the following:

* Utility.  From inception, our Tokens have a specific designated use as the payment currency for buying and selling Internet IT capacity on our Grid.  
* Neutral.  Our Foundation is mission- and value-based, has no shareholders and is not owned or controlled by any institution or government.  
* Green.  Our blockchain is different - and enables much greater scalability to millions  of transactions without requiring outsize energy consumption
* Secure.  Also our blockchain is less vulnerable to large miner consortia controlling hashrates or DDOS and other attacks.  All users and nodes are registered on our blockchain-based identity management platform enhancing security and privacy.


## Why do we say our Token has “utility” and why is this important?

When we talk about “utility”, we mean that our Token has a designated “use” as the exclusive payment currency for buying and selling Internet capacity via our Directory on our Grid.  
This utility is important because it generates additional demand, diversification, volumes and liquidity for Token Holders.  This is an important differentiator for our Token - as digital currencies today generally have limited utility.

# PTO = Public Token Offering

[Read more about our PTO here](/pto).


## Why do we use the term PTO (unlike ICO)

We refer to our token sale as a Public Token offering (PTO) instead of an initial coin offering (ICO).

We believe our token offering is different from some of the other ICOs.  We are already up and running - our technology is fully developed (>10 years) and our Grid is already operational prior to the PTO.

## Where can I buy a Token?

ThreeFold Tokens will be available for sale directly through our app.

One needs only sign up with our [ItsYou.Online](http://itsyou.online) identity management platform and open their e-Wallet on our App.

As payment, we currently accept BTC, USD, GBP and EUR.

## What is the token issuing mechanism?

There will be no more than 100,000,000 TF tokens in existence (Max Supply). No additional TF tokens will ever be generated. Tokens will be tradable on public digital currency exchanges subject to applicable regulations by citizenship and/or country of residence. On these exchanges token holders would be free to buy, sell and trade tokens at market prices. 

10% of TF tokens are reserved by the TFF for its founders, partners, ambassadors and promoters. A maximum of 1/48 of these tokens are issued per month (vesting scheme of 48 months). 

Not more than 20,000,000 TF tokens will be sold during the Public Token Offering, which constitutes max 20% of total token supply. 

All remaining TF tokens, or no less than 70,000,000 are mined by our Miners.

Miners purchase Zero-Nodes/Clusters from ThreeFold Producers. Once the capacity has been validated by our TF Blockchain the TF Miner will receive TF tokens valued at 100% of the price paid for the Zero-Nodes/Clusters. These are new tokens that are created, up and until the 100,000,000 total TF token Max Supply limit is reached. This is the only way TF tokens are created after the Public Token Offering (see the section on Finance and Token Economy).

Incentive TF tokens created for Miners are locked up for the first 12 months. After this period the tokens begin to vest on a monthly basis from month 13 to 24, i.e. released 1/12 each month. 


## How will we create liquidity for Token Holders who wish to sell their Tokens?

We want Token Holders to be able to sell their Tokens, and at the same time allow the Foundation to sell new Tokens, if demand is great enough. To this end, we are installing a queue system on token sales, guaranteeing that Token Holders always receive priority over Foundation sales at each prescribed Token price point ($10, $12...$22, $24.20, ...).

There will be two separate sell queues, the Token Holder sell queue and the Foundation sell queue. The Token Holder sell queue will receive strict and absolute priority over the Foundation sell queue, meaning the Foundation will only ever sell a token if no Token Holder is offering Tokens for sale at that price.

The Token Holder queue will allow Token Holders to list as many tokens as they want, but will take measures to prevent one large seller from preventing other sellers from entering the queue in any meaningful way. 

Only when the Foundation has sold all the newly printed Tokens at a given price point, does the price go up.

The intention of the Foundation is that this system should enable sufficient liquidity for Token Holders who wish to sell Tokens during periods when the Foundation is issuing new Tokens.

The white paper will contain more detailed information.

## Can Token holders just send Tokens to other users of the app? 
Yes.

## On what exchange will the Tokens be listed?

The Tokens will be tradable on the Foundation’s private exchange.

## When will the PTO be held.

The Public Token Offering will be done Q4 2017.

## More details about the PTO

[Read more about our PTO here](/pto).

## What will be my ROI if I buy token? What is your projection for the Token price?

During the PTO, we only sell tokens at ever increasing prices in batches of 1 million tokens. We make no other predictions or guarantees. However, thanks to the utility of our Tokens as designated payment currency for Internet capacity sold on our Grid, we believe our Tokens will be supported by additional demand, volume and diversification.

##  Can I buy Tokens with bank transfer?

Yes, you can buy Tokens with bank transfers. USD, GBP, EUR at first, adding YEN, and CHF at a later date.
We also allow BTC payments at first, adding ETH at a later date.

## Can I buy Tokens if I am in US or I am a US citizen?

No.


## Can I buy Tokens if I am in China or I am a Chinese citizen?

No.

# Guarantees & Safety

## How does TF control the issuing of further tokens?

As per the Token Issuance Mechanism, the Foundation sells tokens at increasing prices up to December 2019.


## Can I reclaim assets owned by ThreeFold foundation?

No. Token Holders should not expect to profit from reclaiming assets or cash from the Foundation. Profits for Token Holders should come from selling the Tokens at a price that is higher than the price at which the Token was purchased.

## KYC and AML Procedures

We take our Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations seriously.  We employ robust onboarding protocols and identity management via itsyou.online.

## Will you have an escrow during the PTO?

No. We are already up and running and we invest the PTO proceeds in additional Internet capacity on our Grid.  We are not awaiting technology or other “development” milestones - so there is no need to have an escrow.

## How is the Foundation structured and where is it based?

See our [FOUNDATION FAQ](/faq/foundation-faq).

## How are the proceeds of the Tokens Used?

The Foundation will use the net proceeds of the PTO for working capital and to deploy additional Internet capacity on our global Grid.  Part of the proceeds of the PTO will be held as cash on balance sheet to support Token liquidity.

# Technical

## Which blockchain is used? What is the issuing format for the ThreeFold Token?

At the PTO, our Tokens will be issued on Ethereum blockchain as ERC20 compliant Tokens.  Over time we intend to migrate our Tokens to our own blockchain called Rivine.io.

## Where can I find the smart contract code?

The ThreeFold Token Smart Contract will be publicly available prior to the start of the PTO.
