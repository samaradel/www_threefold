# Why THREEFOLD Token

For a list of definitions used see our [definitions document](https://github.com/threefoldtoken/legal/blob/master/definitions.md).

### Why buy ThreeFold Tokens (TFTs)?

To purchase the IT Capacity produced by TF Famers, people need to use TFTs as they are the only possible mechanism to buy this capacity on the TF Grid. As such, TFTs have tangible, intrinsic value as they are backed by the internet capacity produced, thus they represent true utility. 


### Why do we need a ThreeFold Token?





Decentralized digital currencies have already gone a long way to solving some of the periphery issues surrounding peer to peer transactions; requiring no intermediaries such as banks, greater trust; secured by cryptography and mathematics, lower friction charges, faster transaction times and no single point of failure.

Even so major problems remain, such as difficulty in scalign the  issues, impossible energy requirements, certain perceived reputational issues and, most importantly, a general absence of intrinsic value collateralized by real assets.

We designed our Token as a scalable currency with real utility and intrinsic value rooted in real assets.

### What are the Foundation’s objectives for the TFT?

The Foundation’s long term objective is to migrate the TFT firmly into the mainstream as a payment instrument used to purchase IT and other services. We seek to:

* Create an alternative currency with intrinsic value rooted in real assets.
* Give our Tokens a designated utility by linking the Token directly to the growth of the Internet.
* Support our Tokens - prioritise liquidity, stability, transparency and exchangeability for Token Holders.
* Ensure the integrity and security of the Tokens for Token Holders.

### Why did we use the word Token vs Coin?

We use the word “Token” because our Tokens are much more than a simple coin. In our view, coins really only have one function:  to act as simple stores of value. Our Tokens represent an economic interest in our Foundation and is the exclusive payment instrument or currency for which farmers can sell Internet IT capacity via our Directory service.

### Is our Token different from other digital currencies?

We designed our Token to be different from other digital currencies in several respects including the following:

* Utility. From inception, our Tokens have a specific designated use as the payment currency for buying and selling Internet IT capacity on our Grid.
* Neutral. Our Foundation is mission- and value-based, has no shareholders and is not owned or controlled by any institution or government.
* Green. Our blockchain is different - and enables much greater scalability to millions of transactions without requiring outsize energy consumption
* Secure. Also our blockchain is less vulnerable to large miner consortia controlling hashrates or DDOS and other attacks. All users and nodes are registered on our blockchain-based identity management platform enhancing security and privacy.

### Why do we say our Token has “utility” and why is this important?

When we talk about “utility”, we mean that our Token has a designated “use” as the exclusive payment currency for buying and selling Internet capacity via our Directory on our Grid.  
This utility is important because it generates additional demand, diversification, volumes and liquidity for Token Holders. This is an important differentiator for our Token - as digital currencies today generally have limited utility.

### Where can I buy a Token?

ThreeFold Tokens will be available for sale directly through our app.

One needs only sign up with our [ItsYou.Online](http://itsyou.online) identity management platform and open their e-Wallet on our App.

As payment, we currently accept BTC, USD, GBP and EUR.

### How many tokens already exists?

Today there are 100,000,000,000 Tokens created.

### What is the Token Issuance Mechanism?

There will be no more than 100,000,000,000 TF tokens in existence (Max Supply). No additional TF tokens will ever be generated. Tokens will be tradable on digital currency exchanges subject to applicable regulations by citizenship and/or country of residence. On these exchanges token holders would be free to buy, sell and trade tokens at market prices.

The distribution of ThreeFold Tokens is as follows:

* ThreeFold Farmers - 98%
  98,000,000,000 (98 billion) Tokens, or 98% of the Max Supply, are issued to Farmers when they connect capacity to the ThreeFold Grid. The Farmer can sell 1/48 of this amount per month. This means by design each Token available to market is backed by capacity

* Foundation = Promotion / Marketing - 1%
  1% of the Max Supply, can be used by the ThreeFold Foundation to sponsor marketing and promotion of the ThreeFold Ecosystem.

* Technology Creators (gig.tech) & Founders - 0.02% per month
  Is reserved for the technology creators & TF Founders, max 48 months. Max 20% can be sold per month of total amount of transactions.


### Can I buy TF Tokens if I am in the US am a US citizen?

Yes, you can purchase directly from from either of the first two independent TF Farming Cooperatives Bettertoken BVBA and/or ThreeFold FZC.

This is the only way that TFTs can be purchased at this time. 

### Can I buy TFTs if I am in China or a Chinese citizen?

Not at this time. Legal precedence and rules surrounding Tokens are to unclear in China today and we have thus chosen to avoid for now. 

### On what exchange will the TFTs be listed?

TFTs will be tradable on multiple Cryto Exchanges (anyone supporting ERC20 tokens)

### Can I buy TFT with bank transfer?

Yes, you can buy TFTs with bank transfers: USD, GBP, EUR, YEN, and CHF at a later date. You can also transfer BTC and/or Ethereum if you prefer.


# Guarantees & Safety

### KYC and AML Procedures

When purchasing TFT from TF Farmers and/or Coorperatives you might be asked to go through a Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) review. This is a process of identifying and verifying your true identity for the protection of both you and TF Farmers.

### How is the Foundation structured and where is it based?

See our [FOUNDATION FAQ](/faq/foundation-faq).
