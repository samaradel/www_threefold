# Why the ThreeFold Token

For a list of definitions used see our [definitions document](https://docs.grid.tf/threefold/info/src/branch/master/legal/definitions.md).


### Why do we need a ThreeFold Token?

To purchase the IT Capacity produced by TF Famers, people need to use TFTs as they are the only possible mechanism to buy this capacity on the TF Grid. As such, TFTs have tangible, intrinsic value as they are backed by the internet capacity produced, thus they represent true utility.

Demand for internet capacity is far outpacing available supply and current hyperscale data center architecture is unable to support the increasing demand.

Data centers compute and store enormous amounts of data and cannot grow fast enough to keep up with the growth of compute and storage demand amid already significant performance and latency issues. IoT workloads require local compute capacity integrated with lots of fast storage capacity. Hyperscale data centers are physically too remote and/or too expensive to do this. Furthermore, governments prefer Internet infrastructure to be “in country”. For most countries hyperscale data centers are based overseas. This exposes a country's data to third-party intervention. Finally, data centers consume ever more electricity trying to keep up with demand spreading a massive carbon footprint.

Decentralized digital currencies have already gone a long way to solving some of the periphery issues surrounding peer to peer transaction, security, lowering friction charges and faster transaction times and no single point of failure.

The TFT together with the TF ecosystem provides a greener more cost effective and locally distributed solution.

### What are the ThreeFold Foundation’s objectives for the TFT?

The ThreeFold Foundation’s objective is to build an ecosystem that brings online a grid of decentralized, distributed, and neutral IT infrastructure and drives the adoption of the TFT as a main currency when purchase such services. The foundation seeks to:

* Create an alternative currency with intrinsic value rooted in real assets.
* Give TFTs a designated utility by linking the TFTs directly to the growth of the Internet.
* Support TFTs - aid in the promotion and marketing of the TF Grid.
* Ensure the integrity and security of the TFT.

### Why did we use Token vs Coin?

We use the word “Token” because the TFT is much more than a simple coin. In our view, coins really only have one function - to act as stores of value. The TFT represents an economic interest in the TF Grid and is the exclusive payment instrument or currency for which IT capacity can buy bought and sold in the TF Directory service.

### How is the TFT different from other digital currencies?

The TFT is designed to be different in several ways:

* Utility - From inception, TFTs have a specific designated use as the payment currency for buying and selling IT capacity on the TF Grid.
* Neutral - There is no central entity, institution or government controlling the TF Grid or issuing TFTs. All TFTs are exclusively issued (created) by the TF Chain for each active Farming Pool which gets and remains connected to the TF Grid.
* Green -  The IT Capacity purchased with TFTs has greater scalability and greater energy efficiency than any other IT Capacity produced today.
* Secure - All users and TF Nodes are registered on the TF Chain identity based management platform enhancing security and privacy.


### Why do TFTs have “Utility” and why is this important?

To use this IT Capacity, through the TF Grid, people need to own ThreeFold Tokens (“TFTs”) as they are the only possible mechanism to purchase this capacity on the TF Grid. As such, TFTs represent a true utility.

### Where can I buy TFTs?

TFTs can can only be purchased directly from from either of the first two independent TF Farming Cooperatives Bettertoken BVBA and/or ThreeFold FZC at this time.

You will need sign up with our [ItsYou.Online](http://itsyou.online) identity management platform and open a TF e-Wallet on our App.


### How many tokens already exists?

By the end of March 2018 the TF Foundation estimates that less than 0.5% of the total amount of TFTs will have been Farmed. The first Farming has been done by over 100 independent Farmers.

Total Max supply of all availble TTFs is 100,000,000,000.


### What is the Token Issuance Mechanism?

There will be a maximum of 100,000,000,000 TF tokens in existence (Max Supply). Tokens will be tradable on digital currency exchanges subject to applicable regulations by citizenship and/or country of residence. On these exchanges token holders would be free to buy, sell and trade tokens at market prices.

All TFT in existence are and will be Farmed:

Portions of the 100,000,000,000 (100 billion max supply) Tokens, are issued monthly to Farmers for connecting IT Capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.

Monthly Issued Tokens (TFTs) per Farming Pool =  average monthly sales price of connected Farming Pool capacity at connection time expressed in tokens / difficulty level

Difficulty level for 2018 is 6. If required the difficulty level can be adjusted with a 80% majority vote of the ThreeFold Ambassadors, by means of the TF Chain.   


### Can I buy TF Tokens if I am in the US am a US citizen?

Yes, as a US citizen you can purchase directly from from either of the first two independent TF Farming Cooperatives Bettertoken BVBA and/or ThreeFold FZC.

This is the only way that TFTs can be purchased at this time.

### Can I buy TFTs if I am in China or a Chinese citizen?

Not at this time. Legal precedence and rules surrounding Crytocurrencies are to unclear in China today and we have thus chosen to avoid for now.

### On what exchange will the TFTs be listed?

TFTs will be tradable on a fully decentralized exchange where you can trade TFT's for BTC and ETH.

### Can I buy TFT using a bank transfer or Bitcoin?

Yes, you can buy TFTs with bank transfers: USD, GBP, EUR, YEN, and CHF at a later date. You can also purchase using Bitcoin and/or Ethereum if you prefer.

# Guarantees & Safety

### KYC and AML Procedures

When purchasing TFT from TF Farmers and/or Cooperatives you might be asked to go through a Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) review. This is a process of identifying and verifying your true identity for the protection of all parties invovled.

### How is the Foundation structured and where is it based?

See our [FOUNDATION FAQ](/faq/foundation-faq).

# Technical

### Which blockchain is used? What is the issuing format for the TFT?

The TFT tokens will be issued on TF-Chain a blockchain setup for the TFT-foundation using the open source technology Rivine.io developed at GIG.tech.

### Where can I find the smart contract code?

The TFT Smart Contract will be publicly available soon.
