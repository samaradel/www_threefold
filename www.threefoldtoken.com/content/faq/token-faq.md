# Why THREEFOLD Token

## Why should I buy Tokens?

The reasons for investors to buy Tokens in the public token offering include the following:

* Good cause:  purchasers are helping us build a new neutral edge Internet
* Potential upside: ThreeFold sits at the intersection of three of today’s most important technologies - Blockchain, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence, and we believe that as our global Grid expands and the capacity available for sale grows, the demand for our Tokens will increas
* Downside Protection and reduced volatility (ie Token price less likely to decrease substantially):  Our Tokens are backed by the full faith and credit and assets of our Foundation.  Our Technology and Grid are already up and running and we believe our Foundation and its assets represent significant value
* High quality team with extensive technology and financial experience
* Existing technology that is very well positioned for Edge networking and outperforms  leading technologies in many categories

## Why do we need a ThreeFold Token?

Digital currencies are well on the way to full acceptance as a mainstream currency in the future.  Benefits include direct peer to peer transactions (requiring no intermediaries such as banks); greater trust (secured by cryptography and mathematics); lower friction charges; faster transaction times and no single point of failure.

Major problems remain, however, such as scalability issues, impossible energy requirements, certain perceived reputational issues - and most importantly, a general absence of intrinsic value collateralized by real assets.

We designed our Token as a safe, scalable currency with real utility and intrinsic value backed by real assets.

## What are the Foundation’s objectives for the TF Token?

The Foundation’s long term objective is to migrate the TF Token firmly into the mainstream as a payment instrument used to purchase IT and other services. We seek  to:

* Create a safe, alternative currency with intrinsic value backed by real assets
* Give our Tokens a designated utility by linking the  Token directly to the growth of the Internet
* Support our Tokens - prioritise liquidity, stability, transparency and exchangeability for Token Holders
* Ensure the integrity and security of the Tokens for Token Holders

## Why did we use the word Token vs Coin?

We use the word “Token” because our Tokens are much more than a simple coin.  In our view, coins really only have one function:  to act as simple stores of value.  Our Tokens represent an  economic interest in our Foundation and is the exclusive payment instrument or currency for which operators can sell IT capacity via our Directory service.

## Is our Token different from other digital currencies.

We designed our Token to be different from other Tokens in several respects including the following:
* Backed.  The Tokens are backed with full economic interests in the Foundation and the Foundation’s assets
* Utility.  From inception, our Tokens have a specific designated use as the payment currency for buying and selling IT capacity on our Grid.  
* Neutral.  Our Foundation is mission- and value-based, has no shareholders and is not owned or controlled by any institution or government.  
* Green.  Our blockchain is different - and enables much greater scalability to millions  of transactions without requiring outsize energy consumption
* Secure.  Also our blockchain is less vulnerable to large miner consortia controlling hashrates or DDOS and other attacks.  All users and nodes are registered on our blockchain-based identity management platform enhancing security and privacy.


## How is our Token “backed” by real assets?

By “backed”, we mean asset-backed. Each Token is collateralized by all of the Foundation’s assets.  The Foundation’s funds and cash flows are invested into revenue-generating assets that grow organically - creating additional value for Token Holders.

## Why do we say our Token has “utility” and why is this important?

When we talk about “utility”, we mean that our Token has a designated “use” as the exclusive payment mechanism for buying and selling Internet capacity via our Directory on our Grid.  
This utility is important because it generates additional demand, diversification, volumes and liquidity for Token Holders.  This is an important differentiator for our Token - as digital currencies today generally have limited utility.

# PTO = Public Token Offering

## Why do we use the term PTO (unlike ICO)

We refer to our token sale as a public token offering (PTO) instead of an initial coin offering (ICO).

We believe our token offering is different from some of the other ICOs.  We are already up and running - our technology is fully developed (>10 years) and our Grid is already operational prior to the PTO.

## Where can I buy a Token?

ThreeFold Tokens will be available for sale directly on our website during the PTO.

One needs only sign up with our [ItsYou.Online](http://itsyou.online) identity management platform and open their e-Wallet on our App.

As payment, we accept  BTC, ETH, USD, GBP, CHF, EUR, YEN, AED and other methods available on exchanges.

## How many tokens already exists?

Today there are 10,000,000 Tokens created and backed by the value of our Foundation and by internet capacity which is committed to be deployed by our operators and hosters over more than 200 locations.

See bottom of our home page where you can see where existing capacity has been deployed.

## How many tokens do we offer as part of our PTO?

We are organizing our Public Token Offering to raise additional capital to deploy more capacity on our Grid. The Token sale will determine the final number of new Tokens issued. At present we are targeting up to 3 mio additional Tokens raising 30 mio USD.

## Will Tokens be freely tradable ?

Yes, the Tokens will be listed on multiple digital currency exchanges.

## When will the PTO be held.

The Public Token Offering will be done Q4 2017.

## More details about the PTO

[Read more about our PTO here](/pto).

## What will be my ROI if I buy token? What is your projection for the Token price?

The Token price will be determined by open market - so we don’t make any predictions or guarantees. However, thanks to the utility of our Tokens as designated payment currency for Internet capacity sold on our Grid, we believe our Tokens will be supported by additional demand, volume and diversification.  Also our Tokens are backed by the Foundation - and we expect the Foundation’s value to grow rapidly.

##  Can I buy Tokens with bank transfer?

Yes, you can buy Tokens with bank transfers (USD, GBP, CHF, EUR, YEN, AED), BTC and ETH.

## Can I buy Tokens if I am in US or I am a US citizen?

No.

# Guarantees & Safety

## How does TF control the issuing of further tokens?

The management team of ThreeFold will suggest when it makes sense to issue more tokens. This will be based on a combination of following criteria

 - There is a concrete need for additional capacity in the grid.
 - Value of Tokens went up too quickly.
 - Not enough liquid Tokens (more demand than supply for allowing people to buy capacity)

Majority is required on our boards (Foundation & Community) before issuing of tokens can happen.


## Can I reclaim assets owned by ThreeFold foundation?

No. Token Holders should not expect to profit from reclaiming assets or cash from the Foundation. Profits for Token Holders should come from selling the Tokens at a price that is higher than the price at which the Token was purchased.


## Strong Identity Management = ItsYou.Online (IYO)

ItsYou.Online is our identity management platform using SMS, address and email to authenticate users. We believe ItsYou.Online’s relevance as an identity management tool extends far beyond Tokens and buying and selling IT capacity.

## KYC and AML Procedures

We take our Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations seriously.  We employ robust onboarding protocols and identity management via itsyou.online.

## Will you have an escrow during the PTO?

No. We are already up and running and we invest the PTO proceeds in additional Internet capacity on our Grid.  We are not awaiting technology or other “development” milestones - so there is no need to have an escrow.

## How is the foundation structured and where is it based?

See our [FOUNDATION FAQ](/faq/foundation-faq).

## How are the proceeds of the Tokens Used?

The Foundation will use the net proceeds of the PTO for working capital and to deploy additional Internet capacity on our global Grid.  Part of the proceeds of the PTO will be held as cash on balance sheet to support Token liquidity.

# Technical

## Which blockchain is used? What is the issuing format for the ThreeFold Token?

At the PTO, our Tokens will be issued on Ethereum blockchain as ERC20 compliant Tokens.  Over time we intend to migrate our Tokens to our own blockchain called Rivine.io.

## Where can I find smart contract code?

The ThreeFold Token Smart Contract is publicly available.
