### ThreeFold Foundation (TFF)

The TF Contract is a smart contract defining capacity transactions.  The TF Contract specifies the key information such as the capacity or service, duration, price per unit, location, etc.  The Contracts are also linked to the APIs which host the service

## ThreeFold Directory

The Directory is a global directory service running on top of our blockchain that publishes all available capacity, services and pricing on our Grid.  The Directory is integrated with our identity management platform, ItsYou.Online, for authentication.

### ThreeFold Community (TFC)

The TF Exchange provides a spot rate exchange service for Token Holders.  The Exchange is fully integrated with the TF App, e-Wallet and Directory and can verify counterparties via itsyou.online

### ThreeFold Producer (TFP)

The Foundation’s long term objective is to migrate our Token firmly into the mainstream as a currency used to purchase IT and other services. The envisaged way to achieve this is by creating a virtuous cycle: Token sales help grow a global grid of IT capacity, and the global grid supports the use of the Token.
 

## ThreeFold Promoter

The TF Promoter is a marketing organization focused on promoting the various Foundation initiatives.  For Token Holders, the Promoter plays a role similar to investor relations - publishing relevant news and information for Token Holders.  On the capacity side, the TF Promoter runs the website managing our Grid via APIs and simple User Interfaces.  The Promoter also prepares cookbooks and provides training for Operators and also educates Token Holders on the benefits of TF Tokens as a preferred currency.  For TF Hosters, the Promoter provides online training and help desk and handles initial procurement

### ThreeFold Reservation

TF Token Holders fall into three broad categories:
- Investors.  Investors and savers who hold TF Tokens as a safe digital currency
- Users.  Producers and purchasers of Internet capacity who use TF Tokens as the designated currency for Internet capacity sold on our Grid
- Believers.  Believers who endorse the Foundation’s core values and ambitions

### ThreeFold Service API

A Zero-Node is a node running the Foundation’s Zero-OS open-source software.  Zero-Nodes are designed to be plug and play and “self driving” so they can be hosted by any Token Holder.  Our Rivine.io blockchain is run on a specific type of Zero-Node.
