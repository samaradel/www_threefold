## General

### ThreeFold Grid (TFG)

The ThreeFold Grid is a global new neutral and sustainable network of IT infrastructure. On this Grid IT capacity is indexed registered on the ThreeFold Directory for easy discovery by purchasers.

This Internet capacity is produced and allocated locally - similar to the way electricity and other utilities are purchased today. This allows any digital service or application provider to host their services and applications in proximity to the end user leading to significantly greater performance, a lower price point and better margins. This is both more cost effective and green.

In this Grid, your data is local to and controlled by you.

### ThreeFold Token (TFT)

The ThreeFold Token is a green and neutral utility Token what is the designated currency for IT capacity bought and sold on the ThreeFold Grid.


### ThreeFold Farmer (TFF)

A ThreeFold Farmer is an independent individual or organizations which purchases ThreeFold Nodes/Clusters and connect them to the internet.

As a result of Farming, i.e. creating additional capacity, ThreeFold Tokens are automatically created by a ThreeFold blockchain smart contract. TFFs need to keep the nodes up and running for at least 98%, which means managing the power & network connection.

Farmers can cultivate both managed and/or unmanaged capacity.

Unmanaged capacity can exist everywhere; in peopleâ€™s home, in mobile telephone masts, in utility cabinets, next to railways or motorways, anywhere where internet lines meet electrical outlets. This capacity is deployed to the Grid and has no people involved to manage its operations (apart from the physical aspects).  Farmers have no access to the TF Nodes purchased. They can only use the capacity produced in the exact same way as any other user, i.e. through the TF Blockchain, in a secure private and neutral way, equally applicable to all. Who is responsible for maintaining the unmanaged capacity?

Managed capacity is capacity that sits in a datacenter environment where people operate and maintain supervision of the capacity connected to the Grid and published in the TF Directory. SLA (Service Level Agreements) are provided on this capacity like uptime, guaranteed bandwidth, response times, ...


### TF Directory (TFD)

A blockchain powered directory service where ThreeFold Farmers list their available IT capacity for sale.
Each ThreeFold Farmer defines the price at which they want to sell their capacity.

The Directory is integrated with our identity management platform, ItsYou.Online, for authentication.


### Internet IT capacity

The Information Technology capacity like storage, compute, applications, ...
Example: docker container, database, website, blog, archive storage system, ...

### ThreeFold App

The App is a mobile application which integrates an e-wallet.  The App will allow ThreeFold users to securely keep Tokens in their e-Wallet, send and receive Tokens, enter smart contracts, search our Directory for IT Capacity and other administrative functions.


## ThreeFold Ecosystem


### ThreeFold Architect

ThreeFold Architects have the knowledge of the technology and processes and provide this expertise in multiple locations worldwide. 

They are independent knowledge centers whose work includes: 

- Community engagement - Since all of the software we use is open-source, feedback and contribution from the developer community plays a crucial role in subsequent development. Architects increase stability, trust and understanding of this technology by engaging the community. 
- Developer programs - Stimulate proliferation of applications running on the TF Grid, e.g. developers worldwide would be able to apply for free capacity.
- Strategic partnerships - Partner up with educational institutions to propagate new conceptual thinking in the IT community.
- Engineering meetups and roadshows - spread knowledge about the TF Technology and its capabilities. 
- Development of more components for the TF Software stack.
- Quality assurance (security, code quality, performance) of the software stack.

Although Architects are independent from each other we expect the ThreeFold to play an important role in the bootstrap period to get them up to speed.  After this period they will be completely self sufficient


### ThreeFold Guardians

ThreeFold Guardians protect the values and principles of the TF Foundation within the TF Ecosystem. All Foundation activities are transparent, open and visible to all.  The guardians also have the responsibility of how and when to allocate funds from the ThreeFold Token Pool. 

There will be up to 100 Guardians.
