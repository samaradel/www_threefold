## General

### ThreeFold (TF)

Short name for our foundation = TFF.

### TF Token (TFT)

The ThreeFold Token is our utility green and neutral Token.  The Token is the designated currency for capacity sold on our Grid

### TF Directory (TFD)

The blockchain powered directory service in which all ThreeFold Miners can list their capacity.
Each TF Miner defines the price at which he/she wants to sell their capacity.

The Directory is integrated with our identity management platform, ItsYou.Online, for authentication.

### TF Grid (TFG)

Our TF Grid is the global network of Internet IT infrastructure that is indexed by the ThreeFold Directory.
Our TF Grid is comprised of all the Internet IT capacity generated by TF Miners.  Our Grid is our “new, neutral, edge Internet."

### Internet IT capacity (capacity)

The Information Technology capacity like storage, compute, applications, ...
Example: docker container, database, website, blog, archive storage system, ...

### ThreeFold App

The App is a mobile application which integrates an e-wallet.  The App will allow TF Users to securely keep Tokens in their e-Wallet, send and receive Tokens, enter smart contracts, search our Directory for capacity and other administrative functions

## ThreeFold Ecosystem

### ThreeFold Foundation (TFF)

TFF is a non-profit organization which issues the tokens and is controlled by an independent Board who in turn are overseen by independent Ambassadors.

TFF also promotes our network and further develops our existing technology.

TFF is 100% independent from any of the further mentioned organizations and aims to remain small & effective.

### ThreeFold Community (TFC)

--- The Community is everybody committed to the Threefold Values and mission. This means all people involved in our Ecosystem. The Founders, Ambassadors, Evangelists and Team Members. 

Members all over the world buying the ThreeFold Token (TFT). By means of these TFTs the TFC can buy capacity available on the ThreeFold Grid (TFG). 

### --- ThreeFold Producer (TFP)

A TFP produces the ThreeFold Nodes following guidelines provided by the TFF.

A TFP will assemble, compile the software, insert the initial bootstrap private key in the secure boot area and ship the Nodes to the ThreeFold Miners.

All TFP’s are independant from each other. In this way the TFF ensures neutrality & security. It's important to note, that source code gets compiled by different parties.

### --- ThreeFold Farmer (TFF)

TFFs are independent organizations which buy ThreeFold Nodes/Clusters and connect them to the internet.

As a result of farming, i.e. creating additional capacity, TF tokens are automatically created by a TF blockchain smart contract. TFFs need to keep the nodes up and running for at least 98%, which means managing the power & network connection.

TFFs have NO access to the ThreeFold Nodes or Clusters they have provisioned. They can only use that capacity like any other TFC member would: through the blockchain, in all neutrality, privacy and security.


### --- ThreeFold University (TFU)
The Foundation is actively working to establish centers of knowledge and expertise, in multiple strategic locations worldwide.

Community engagement: all of our software is open-source and we understand the importance of feedback and contribution from the developer community. This will significantly increase stability, trust and understanding of this technology.
Partnerships:  In order to propagate new conceptual thinking in the IT community, we have to make the technology and knowledge base open to the community (business & education).
Engineering meetups and roadshows: To spread the knowledge about the platform and its possibilities.
Wiki-style knowledge platforms.

## Components
### ThreeFold Blockchain

Our blockchain is different from some of the other blockchains in that it is run on a separate dedicated pool of Zero-Nodes and has numerous additional features including support for storage, secure execution environments, metadata servers and identity management.  

## Varia

### ThreeFold Reservation

The TF Reservation is a smart contract defining capacity transactions.  The TF Contract specifies the key information such as the capacity or service, duration, price per unit, location, etc.

### ThreeFold Service API

TF Services API is a rest-based API specified in RAML (a definition language).  When registering a service to our Directory the specific TF Service API must be registered with it
