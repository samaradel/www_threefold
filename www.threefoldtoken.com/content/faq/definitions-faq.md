## General

### TF Grid (TFG)

The ThreeFold Grid is a global new neutral and sustainable network of IT infrastructure. On this Grid IT capacity is indexed registered on the ThreeFold Directory for easy discovery by purchasers.

This Internet capacity is produced and allocated locally - similar to the way electricity and other utilities are purchased today. This allows any digital service or application provider to host their services and applications in proximity to the end user leading to significantly greater performance, a lower price point and better margins. This is both more cost effective and green.

In this Grid, your data is local to and controlled by you.

### TF Token (TFT)

The ThreeFold Token is a green and neutral utility Token what is the designated currency for IT capacity bought and sold on the ThreeFold Grid.


### ThreeFold Farmer (TFF)

A ThreeFold Farmer is an independent individual or organizations which purchases ThreeFold Nodes/Clusters and connect them to the internet.

As a result of Farming, i.e. creating additional capacity, ThreeFold Tokens are automatically created by a ThreeFold blockchain smart contract. TFFs need to keep the nodes up and running for at least 98%, which means managing the power & network connection.

Farmers cultivating unmanaged capacity have NO access to the ThreeFold Nodes or Clusters they have provisioned. They can only use that capacity like any other user: through the blockchain. 




### TF Directory (TFD)

A blockchain powered directory service where ThreeFold Farmers list their available IT capacity for sale.
Each ThreeFold Farmer defines the price at which they want to sell their capacity.

The Directory is integrated with our identity management platform, ItsYou.Online, for authentication.



### Internet IT capacity (capacity)

The Information Technology capacity like storage, compute, applications, ...
Example: docker container, database, website, blog, archive storage system, ...

### ThreeFold App

The App is a mobile application which integrates an e-wallet.  The App will allow TF Users to securely keep Tokens in their e-Wallet, send and receive Tokens, enter smart contracts, search our Directory for capacity and other administrative functions

## ThreeFold Ecosystem for creation of Capacity




### ThreeFold Chefs

ThreeFold Producer (TFP)

A TFP produces the ThreeFold Nodes following guidelines provided by the TFF.

A TFP will assemble, compile the software, insert the initial bootstrap private key in the secure boot area and ship the Nodes to the ThreeFold Miners.

All TFPâ€™s are independant from each other. In this way the TFF ensures neutrality & security. It's important to note, that source code gets compiled by different parties.

ThreeFold University (TFU)

The Foundation is actively working to establish centers of knowledge and expertise, in multiple strategic locations worldwide.

Community engagement: all of our software is open-source and we understand the importance of feedback and contribution from the developer community. This will significantly increase stability, trust and understanding of this technology.
Partnerships:  In order to propagate new conceptual thinking in the IT community, we have to make the technology and knowledge base open to the community (business & education).
Engineering meetups and roadshows: To spread the knowledge about the platform and its possibilities.
Wiki-style knowledge platforms.


### ThreeFold Guardians

A pool of 100 Guardians. Main function is to guard the decentralized organization of Threefold.



### ThreeFold Foundation: Ecosystem for safeguarding the decentralized functioning of the above ecosystem



**ThreeFold Founders**


**ThreeFold Ambassadors**


**ThreeFold Team Members**


**ThreeFold Evengalists**

### ThreeFold Foundation (TFF)

TFF is a non-profit organization which issues the tokens and is controlled by an independent Board who in turn are overseen by independent Ambassadors.

TFF also promotes our network and further develops our existing technology.

TFF is 100% independent from any of the further mentioned organizations and aims to remain small & effective.

### ThreeFold Community (TFC)

The Community is everybody committed to the Threefold Values and mission. This means all people involved in our Ecosystem. The Founders, Ambassadors, Evangelists and Team Members.

Members all over the world buying the ThreeFold Token (TFT). By means of these TFTs the TFC can buy capacity available on the ThreeFold Grid (TFG).


## Components
### ThreeFold Blockchain

Our blockchain is different from some of the other blockchains in that it is run on a separate dedicated pool of Zero-Nodes and has numerous additional features including support for storage, secure execution environments, metadata servers and identity management.  

## Varia

### ThreeFold Reservation

The TF Reservation is a smart contract defining capacity transactions.  The TF Contract specifies the key information such as the capacity or service, duration, price per unit, location, etc.

### ThreeFold Service API

TF Services API is a rest-based API specified in RAML (a definition language).  When registering a service to our Directory the specific TF Service API must be registered with it
