### What is included in the ThreeFold’s portfolio of open-source technology?

All of our IP is open-source and is constantly being improved upon and extended.

Included in the technology portfolio are the following key elements:

* [**Jumpscale9**](https://github.com/jumpscale)
  * Jumpscale 9 is an automation system for software design using simplified scripts and APIs
* [**Zero-OS**](https://github.com/zero-os)
  * The Zero-OS is among the greenest and most efficient IT operating systems globally.
  * It contains a full-blown block based storage system and object storage.
* [**TF Blockchain**](https://github.com/rivine)
  * The blockchain is a distributed, “proof of stake” blockchain. As a multi-chain platform, it is not constrained in terms of scalability and slow transaction processing times. Also, proof of stake blockchain implementations do not consume impossible amounts of energy.
* [**ItsYou.Online**](https://github.com/itsyouonline)
  * Itsyou.online is a secure identity management platform. Its relevance as an identity management tool extends far beyond buying and selling Internet IT capacity and tokens. This account on Github will also host our future Blockchain-as-a-Service platform.

### How was our technology developed?

Our open-source technology has been developed over a period of 15 years with over USD $100 million invested. We developed all the core components in-house, and do not use any 3rd party commercial technology components which enables us to more rapidly develop without being constrained by those components or spend needlessly. We use open-source components like the Linux Kernel, but we check, build, and version control these components ourselves.

We understand every component. We know all our source code inside out and are therefore aware of every bit that creates the solution. We do not (nor will we ever) provide backdoors for any government or security organization. We believe in 100% freedom of choice and 100% privacy for all our customers.

### What are the most important attributes of the Zero-OS and TF-Nodes?

Our Zero-OS is built for Edge infrastructure which delivers automation, self-healing, and hyper-distribution.

Our TF-Nodes are secure, self-operating, and green. The “Zero” components are super straightforward. The Zero-OS has no filesystem, no volume driver, no shell (terminal), no SSH server, etc. This delivers higher levels of security, faster installation and does not require manual device by device upgrades. Our TF-Nodes are plug and play, “self driving” so anyone can become a TF Farmer by simply connecting it to a reliable internet and power source.

### Why did we choose to build our own blockchain?

We originally built our blockchain to power a neutral and independent identity management system which is used by our cloud-computing technology. We believe this blockchain has advantages in comparison to existing blockchains when it comes to scalability and improved security.

### What are the most important attributes of our blockchain?

The neutral and independent Itsyou.online blockchain technology is scalable, secure, and green.

The key differentiators of our blockchain include:

* Green. This blockchain is running on a dedicated TF-Node resource pool which requires a lot less power.
* Scalable. This multi-chain platform does not depend on existing big chains.
* Advanced Features. Our blockchain supports storage, creates a secure execution environment, metadata servers and other features.
* Identity Management. This blockchain works with Itsyou.online Identity Management platform, providing robust onboarding protocols for users.
* Additional Security. Our blockchain’s dedicated TF-Node and TF Grid is widely distributed and benefits from enhanced security features such as two path authentication.
