### What is included in the TreeFold’s portfolio of open-source technology?

All of our IP is open-source and is constantly being improved upon and extended.  

ThreeFold will fund further development from its proceeds. Included in the technology portfolio are the following key elements:

- [**Jumpscale9**](https://github.com/jumpscale)
    - Jumpscale 9 is an automation system for software design using simplified scripts and APIs
- [**Zero-OS**](https://github.com/zero-os)
    - The Zero-OS is among the greenest and most efficient IT operating systems globally
    - it  contains a full blown block based storage system and an object stor.
- [**TF Blockchain**](https://github.com/rivine)  
    - The blockchain is a distributed, “proof of stake” blockchain.  As a multi-chain platform, it is not constrained in terms of scalability and slow transaction processing times - also proof of stake blockchain implementations do not consume impossible amounts of energy
- [**ItsYou.Online**](https://github.com/itsyouonline)
    - Itsyou.online is a  secure identity management platform.  Its relevance as an identity management tool extends far beyond Tokens and buying and selling Internet IT capacity. This account on Github will also host our future Blockchain As A Service platform.

### How was our technology developed?

Our open-source technology has been developed over a period of 15 years with over USD 100 million invested.  We developed all the core components in house, we do not use any 3rd party commercial technology components (this provides us with economical benefits and allows us to change, check and modify everything we use at any time). We use open-source components like the Linux Kernel but we check, build and version control these components ourselves.  

We understand every component 100% used - we know all our source code inside out and are therefore aware of everybit that creates the solution.  We do not (nor ever will) provide backdoors for any government or security organization.  We believe in 100% freedom of choice and 100% privacy for all our customers

### What are the most important attributes of the Zero-OS and TF-Nodes?

Our Zero OS is build for Edge infrastructure which delivers automation, self-healing and hyper-distribution.

Our TF-Nodes are Secure, Self Operating and Green. The “Zero” components are super straightforward - the Zero-OS has no filesystem, no volume driver, no shell (terminal), no SSH server, etc. This delivers higher levels of security, faster installation and does not require manual device by device upgrades.  Our Zero Nodes are plug and play “self driving” so anyone can become a TF Farmer by simply connecting it to the internet and a reliable powersource.

### Why did we choose to build our own blockchain?

We originally built our blockchain to power a neutral and independent identity management system which is used by our cloud-computing technology. We believe this blockchain has  advantages in comparison to existing blockchains when it comes to scalability and improved security.

### What are the most important attributes of our blockchain?

The neutral and independent Its You Online blockchain technology is scalable, secure and green.  

The key differentiators of our blockchain include:
- Green.  This blockchain is running on a dedicated TF-Node resource pool which requires a lot less less power.
- Scalable.  This multi-chain platform does not depend on existing big chains.
- Advanced features.  Our blockchain supports storage, creates a secure execution environment, metadata servers and other features.
- Identity Management.  This blockchain works with Itsyou.online Identity Management platform - providing robust onboarding protocols for users.
- Additional Security.  Our blockchain’s dedicated TF-Node TF-Grid is widely distributed and benefits from enhanced security features such as two path authentication.
