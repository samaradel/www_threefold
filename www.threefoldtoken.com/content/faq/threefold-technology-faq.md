### What is included in the Foundation’s portfolio of open-source technology?

All of our IP is open-source and is constantly being improved upon and extended.  

The ThreeFold Foundation will fund further development from its proceeds. Included in the technology portfolio are the following key elements:

- [**Jumpscale9**](https://github.com/jumpscale)
    - Jumpscale 9 is an automation system for software design using simplified scripts and APIs
- [**Zero-OS**](https://github.com/zero-os)
    - The Zero-OS is among the greenest and most efficient IT operating systems globally
    - it also consists of a full blow block based storage system as well as an object stor.
- [**Rivine.io**](https://github.com/rivine)  
    - The Rivine.io blockchain is a distributed, “proof of stake” blockchain.  As a multi-chain platform, Rivine.io is not constrained in terms of scalability and slow transaction processing times - also Rivine.io does not consume impossible amounts of energy
- [**ItsYou.Online**](https://github.com/itsyouonline)
    - Itsyou.online is a  secure identity management platform.  Its relevance as an identity management tool extends far beyond Tokens and buying and selling Internet IT capacity.
    - This account on Github will also host our future Blockchain As A Service platform.

### How was our technology developed?

Our open-source technology has been developed over a period of 15 years with over USD 100 million invested.  We developed all the core components.  We do not use 3rd party commercial technology components (this allows us to change, check and modify everything we use at any time). We use open-source components like Linux, however, we check, build and version control these components ourselves.  

We 100% understand every component used - meaning we have all our source code and are be more reliable.  We do not (nor ever will) provide backdoors for any government or security organization.  We believe in 100% freedom of choice and 100% privacy for all our customers

### What are the most important attributes of the Zero-OS and Zero Nodes?

Our Zero OS is ideally suited for Edge infrastructure which requires automation, self-healing and hyper-distribution.

--- Our Zero-Nodes are Secure, Self Driving and Green. Our “Zero” components are super straightforward - the Zero-OS has no filesystem, no volume driver, no shell (terminal), no SSH server, etc. which results in better security, fast installation and does not require upgrades.  Also our Zero Nodes are plug and play “self driving” so anyone can become a TF Farmer by simply connecting it to the internet and a powersource.

### Why did we choose to build our own blockchain?

We originally built our blockchain to power our identity management system and our cloud-computing technology. We believe our blockchain has certain advantages relative to existing blockchains like scalability and improved security.

### What are the most important attributes of our blockchain?

Our blockchain technology is scalable, secure and green.  

The key differentiators of our blockchain include:
- Green.  We  run our blockchain on a dedicated Zero-Node resource pool which requires much less powerage.
- Scalability.  Our multi-chain platform does not depend on existing big chains.
- Additional Features.  Our blockchain has support for storage, secure execution environments, metadata servers and other features.
- Identity Management.  Our blockchain works with our Itsyou.online Identity Management platform - providing robust onboarding protocols for all users.
- Additional Security.  Our blockchain’s dedicated Zero-Node network is widely distributed and benefits from enhanced security features such as two path authentication.
