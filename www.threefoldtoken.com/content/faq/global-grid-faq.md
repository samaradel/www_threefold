## Our Grid

### Why do we need a new, neutral “Edge” Internet Grid

The Internet has a Trillion Dollar problem. Today the demand for Internet capacity is far outstripping the available infrastructure due to new applications like Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT) and Self Healing Technology.

The existing hyperscale cloud infrastructure cannot cope with this outsized demand as the requirements for land, power and funding are just too great. We (and most other experts) believe the solution to these trillion dollar problems is migration of IT capacity to the Edge - ie a “hyper-distributed” network infrastructure.

For more on this see [“Why do we need a new Internet” blog post](/information/need-for-new-neutral-internet/).

### What is our TF Grid (TFG)?

Our Grid is the network of all the distributed infrastructure capacity that is available for sale via our Directory (TF Directory).

At the bottom of our [homepage](https://threefoldtoken.com),  you can see a  map which shows how much capacity is available.

### How is our Grid different from existing IT infrastructure?

We have a hyper-distributed Edge network -  our nodes are located  very close to capacity users. Our network is neutral,  very  green and very secure.  We believe the internet should be owned by the people using it - not enormous companies. This is very different from the majority of Internet infrastructure which is centralised and owned by large billion dollar datacenters.

For more on this see [“Why do we need a new Internet” blog post](/information/need-for-new-neutral-internet/).

### What infrastructure is operating on our Grid?

Our Grid today is built by standard of the shelf infrastructure and operated our Zero OS operating system.  The grid contains a mix of large racks using off-the-shelf components that are typically located in data centers - as well as  pre-fabricated smaller / mobile  for hyperdistributed Zero-Nodes.

## Our Directory

### What is our Directory service?

Our directory service (TF Directory) is a global directory service running on top of a (private) blockchain that publishes all available capacity, services and pricing on our Grid. All capacity that is sold via our Directory must be purchased using our Tokens.

### When will I be able to use the Grid and Directory Service?

Our Grid is already up and running. At the time of the launch for ThreeFold (March 1st 2018), more than 200 TF Farmers, are members - operating their own infrastructure and generating capacity. All available capacity on the Grid is registered for sale via the TF Directory. All purchases are made with Tokens through an API.

### What is the value of our Directory for TF Farmer Miners?

TF Farmer Farmers who generate Internet IT capacity on their own infrastructure can make their capacity available for sale on the TF Directory.  Farmers who use the Directory (and therefore accept our Tokens as payment) benefit from marketing and distribution for their capacity (at no extra cost) as well as providing certain and seamless transactions without concerns about currency fluctuations or other factors.

### How are IT capacity sales transacted?

Once a TF Farmer is registered on our Directory, the available capacity becomes visible to users of our grid. All transactions are made "machine to machine" - meaning they are API-driven based on smart contracts. The smart contract specifies the key information such as the capacity or service, duration, price per unit, location, etc.  All transactions on the TF Directory are executed using TF Tokens.  The Tokens are automatically deposited in the TF Farmer’s e-Wallet.
