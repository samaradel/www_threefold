## Our Grid

### Why do we need a new, neutral “Edge” Internet Grid

The Internet has a USD Trillion problem. Today demand for Internet capacity is far outstripping the available infrastructure due to new applications like Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence.

The existing hyperscale cloud infrastructure cannot cope with this outsize demand as the requirements for land, power and funding are just too great. We (and most other experts) believe the solution to these $trillion problems is migration of Internet IT capacity to the Edge - ie a “hyper-distributed” network infrastructure.

For more on this see [“Why do we need a new Internet” blog post](/information/need-for-new-neutral-internet/).

### What is our Grid?

Our Grid is the network of all the distributed infrastructure and capacity that is available for sale via our Directory (for Tokens).

See bottom of our home page, which shows how much capacity is available.

### How is our Grid different from existing IT infrastructure?

We have a hyper-distributed Edge network - meaning that our nodes are located close to users. Our network is very neutral, green and very secure.

This is very different from the majority of Internet infrastructure which is centralised in large $ billion datacenters (owned by a handful of large tech companies).

For more on this see [“Why do we need a new Internet” blog post](/information/need-for-new-neutral-internet/).

### What infrastructure is operating on our Grid?
Our Grid today is comprised mainly of infrastructure that operates our Zero-Nodes.

## Our Directory

### What is our Directory service?

Our Directory service is a global directory service running on top of our blockchain that publishes all available capacity, services and pricing on our Grid. All capacity that is sold via our Directory must be purchased using our Tokens.

### When will I be able to use the Grid and Directory Service?

Our Grid is already up and running. At the time of our Private Token Offering more than 200 TF Miners are members - operating their own infrastructure and generating capacity. All available capacity on the Grid is registered for sale via our Directory service. All purchases are made with Tokens through an API.

### What is the value of our Directory for TF Operator Miners?

TF Operator Miners who generate Internet IT capacity on their own infrastructure can make their capacity available for sale on our TF Directory.  Operator Miners who use our Directory (and therefore accept our Tokens as payment) benefit from enhanced marketing and distribution for their capacity (at no extra cost) as well as providing certain and seamless transactions without concerns about currency fluctuations or other factors.

### How are Internet IT capacity sales transacted?

Once a TF Miner is registered on our Directory, the available capacity becomes visible to Users of our Grid. Transactions are machine to machine - meaning they are API-driven based on smart contracts. The smart contract specifies the key information such as the capacity or service, duration, price per unit, location, etc.  All transactions on the Directory are executed using our Tokens.  The Tokens are automatically deposited in the TF Miner’s e-Wallet.
