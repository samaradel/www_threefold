### Why Stateless Computing?

The creation of a new Internet based on 100 of thousands of smaller and larger edge nodes needs a complete new operating system that lowers the cost to operate computer nodes, while getting the max performance out of it. GIG took a complete new approach to the activation of bare-metal servers and storage systems in function of a green and neutral Internet platform with the use of a complete new operating system, extremely lightweight and highly distributed.

GIG developed all open-source components, [Zero-OS](https://github.com/Zero-OS) needed for the deployment of bare machines functioning as Internet nodes and application hosts, in relation to building a gigantic edge cloud.

[Zero-OS](https://github.com/Zero-OS) creates the ideal compute platform to run containerized applications and software code on secure and high-available IT infrastructure.

[Zero-OS](https://github.com/Zero-OS) can be deployed by anyone that is willing to make server and storage capacity available in their markets and within the GIG network.

### Benefits of Stateless Computing

* **Performance**: lightweight OS with a minimal overhead, for extreme performance
* **Free**: finds the optimal performance configuration of server & storage nodes at no extra cost
* **Privacy**: no data footprint remains in place while workloads move from one node to another
* **Distributed**: capacity is generated without the need for datacenters: *At The Edge*
* **High-available**: easy creation of clusters while applications run in fragmented segments
* **Portability**: moving software from one node to another within the grid is instant
* **Secure**: open-source distributed software with transparent code. No security backdoors
* **Green**: energy-efficient OS resulting in very low node power consumption
