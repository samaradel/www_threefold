Datacenters are huge buildings full of computers providing internet resources for large regions. They cost billions of dollars to build and need huge amounts of power to run. Lots of parts in the operation process still need human intervention and thus theyâ€™re prone to fail leaving large regions at a time without internet. The growth of the internet makes this a unsustainable situation we need to find a solutions for.
