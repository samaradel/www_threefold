# How To Obtain ThreeFold Tokens?

There is more than one answer to this question.
If you are interested in only buying tokens you can do this at [TFTOKENS.COM](http://www.tftokens.com).

Another option is becoming a farmer by hosting a ThreeFold Node or Cluster. You can buy these through a Farming Cooperatives. The Farming Cooperatives have several ways for you to contribute to the Threefold Grid. You can find our Farming Cooperatives [HERE.](/community)  



Please contact us through the chat widget on the website or the live chat in the smartphone app for more information on becoming a TF Farmer.
