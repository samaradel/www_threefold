### Design of new currency backed by real assets

GIG has partnered with the [Threefold Token Foundation](http://www.threefoldtoken.com/) to create a payment mechanism to purchase IT capacity on a neutral and green Internet.

* *Backed* Each Token is backed by real assets. Tokens are currency for buying and selling IT capacity.
* *Green* Rivine's blockchain algorithms enable an ultra safe and scalable compute/storage grid while being 10x more power efficient.
* *Neutral* All of tech is open-source. The Foundation is owned 100% by the Token Holders, while all users and nodes are registered on our transparent and immutable blockchain.

### Why a new digital currency?

Digital currencies are well on the way to full acceptance as a mainstream currency in the future - providing significant benefits such as direct peer to peer transactions, greater trust secured by cryptography and mathematics; lower charges; faster transactions and no single point of failure.

However, major problems remain such as scalability issues, slow transaction times, impossible energy requirements, reputational issues, no identity management - and most importantly, a general absence of intrinsic value backed by real assets.
