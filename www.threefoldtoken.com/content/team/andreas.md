Andreas strongly believes that behind every so called problem lays a big opportunity. He loves to build symbiotic relationships for people and businesses to create wealth. For Andreas true passion only arises if you live up to the secret formula of ‘do what you love and love what you do’. 
In his former business life Andreas was the leader of multinational sales teams for a number of US IT companies in both startup and mature stages. Before joining ThreeFold Andreas was responsible for GIG’s global channel sales activities.
