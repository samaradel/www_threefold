The need for Internet capacity is growing fast, in both the number of users around the globe and more connected devices in already established regions. Current architecture hyper scale datacenters will not be able to cope with this demand as the requirements for power and funding are too big.  

The Foundation believes the solution to this trillion dollar problem is the migration of Internet IT capacity to the “Edge”, close to where the users of the internet are. Today's infrastructure is heavily centralized: less than 20 big corporations in the world own more than 80% of the Internet capacity, resulting in inequalities in distribution.

Over the last +10 years we have developed a technology which allows IT to behave much like a real utility,
consuming up to 10 times less energy and 100% self healing without involvement of IT specialists.

Threefold wants to deploy capacity in this new paradigm local to the users where needed, managed by smaller clusters,
and funded by all of us by means of a new digital currency.
