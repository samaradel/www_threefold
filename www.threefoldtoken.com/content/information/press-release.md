### THREEFOLD IS BUILDING A NEW INTERNET & LAUNCHES TOKEN

DUBAI - March 30, 2018 - The ThreeFold Foundation, a nonprofit organization, is thrilled to announce the launch of the **ThreeFold Token** (TFT) and the **ThreeFold Grid**, a new and neutral internet.

ThreeFold is creating a new internet, based on innovative technologies and powered by millions of people, and is launching a unique digital currency backed by internet infrastructure.

*"The Internet today is not neutral; it’s mostly delivered and controlled by a few tech giants. It’s time to take it back," says Kristof De Spiegeleer, **Founder at the Threefold Foundation**.*

The TFT is a very different type of token:

* TFT is a real crypto asset, backed by globally decentralized internet capacity = the ThreeFold Grid;

* There has been no ICO (Initial Coin Offering); every token created is the result of connecting computer and storage hardware to the internet;

* TFTs are mined like Bitcoin but the mining is green and delivers useful internet capacity: storage and computing capacity for any kind of IT workload = farming;

* Six farmer cooperatives are active and helping Threefold to onboard new farmers;

* Our token has implemented *atomic swaps* (atomic cross-chain trading), an exciting new blockchain technology that enables the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another without a centralized exchange. Over ten cryptocurrencies will be supported at launch.

The technology behind ThreeFold Token is unique and open source:

* A new operating system that delivers internet capacity at up to 10 times less power use than today’s datacenters;

* A distributed self-healing system that can manage millions of internet nodes;

* A secure, scalable, and green blockchain built using a proof of stake consensus.

De Spiegeleer continues: "We already have more than 100 farmers that are producing capacity worth more than US $50 million, and more are connecting every day."
