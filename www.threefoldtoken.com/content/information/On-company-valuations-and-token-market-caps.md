On company valuations and token market caps

> We wanted to make a digital currency that is rooted in true value, both physically and ethically. We think we managed to do that.

> We did so by linking our ThreeFold Token to an internet capacity providing global grid, run by a foundation that has an implied valuation of more than the total market cap of all ThreeFold Tokens in existence. The technology keeping this grid up and running will be open source, increasing transparency and neutrality. It will also be very power efficient, resulting in cost effective internet capacity.

### The ThreeFold Token and ThreeFold Foundation

We imagined ThreeFold Token with a seemingly simple goal in mind: To make a widely accepted cryptocurrency that is rooted in assets which have room for growth. We believe we managed to do this - we peg the token value in fiat to the biggest commodity on the planet: the internet. Let's explain how.

The Threefold Foundation will deploy internet server technology that is up to ten times more power-efficient than current technology. This implies we are able to run efficiently on a wide range of hardware, while offering capacity living up to current expectations at attractive pricepoints. This capacity can be sold to IT companies and other users profitably.

Selling capacity on our Grid happens via our machine to machine Directory service. Purchases of computing capacity via our Directory service can only be transacted using our Tokens, providing guaranteed and seamless transactions without concerns about currency fluctuations or other factors.


#### Token utility

The token has built-in utility by being redeemable for IT capacity in this Grid. Because cloud storage and computation are becoming bigger and bigger forces in the economic landscape, we feel confident saying this results in tokens having a dynamic and growing market, serving a highly actual need. This functions as a utility with room for growth.

Should tokens go up (or down) in price relative to fiat currencies, the amount of capacity one can buy for one token goes up (or down) correspondingly. In other words, capacity gets fixed in fiat prices, meaning token growth will not result in capacity becoming more expensive.

Let's now consider what it would mean for token valuation and the value of the foundation to be in balance. If the current token price is USD 10, and there are 10 million tokens out there, the token market cap is 100 million USD. This should be somehow in relation to the potential (or the realizations) of the technology and organization behind the token. However, as the ICO craze of summer 2017 has shown, organizations can receive massively optimistic valuations overnight. This is why we organize our PTO somewhat differently: Rather than selling at a fixed price, or all tokens at a single auction, we decided to take a different approach, by releasing tokens as the ThreeFold Grid grows. There will be at most 100 million tokens in existence.


#### Token issuance

How do we do this? There will be at most 100 million tokens printed. The first 10 million tokens are assigned to the ThreeFold Foundation. We will sell up to 25 million tokens during the Public Token Offering, at 10 to 12 USD, depending on the bonus schedule. The remaining (vast majority) 65 million of tokens will get released through the Operator Incentive Program.

The Operator Incentive Program states that any operator buying hardware from the ThreeFold Foundation (or its hardware partner) will receive an amount of tokens corresponding to the dollar value of the purchased hardware one year later. To be more precise, the ThreeFold Foundation will communicate a current token price on the website, and reward hardware purchases with the corresponding number of tokens in a smart contract with a one year lockup period.
> For example, let's say an operator purchases 60K worth of hardware while the current token price as communicated by the ThreeFold Foundation is 15 USD. This means that the operator will receive 60K/15 = 4000 ThreeFold Tokens in a smart contract with a lock-up period of one year. Provided that the operator keeps his hardware running, those 4000 tokens will be released after that year.

This means that the operators will receive a bonus on top of any capacity that they sell. By tying the release of the vast majority to actual growth of the ThreeFold Grid, it is our belief that this will result in the ThreeFold Token being rooted in value, by having the number of tokens out there correlate with the size of third party investments in the ThreeFold Grid.

#### The ThreeFold Foundation

We have started the Threefold Foundation to support and deploy this technology to build a global ThreeFold Grid delivering IT capacity in a flexible shape: in traditional datacenter architectures where that is required, local and decentralized "edge" architecture where it is possible. The combination of these two factors results in a new global grid that can function as a new Internet.

We will organize the foundation as a not-for profit, having a board of ambassadors coming from all parts of the globe and a diversity of backgrounds. We will practice open bookkeeping, allowing anyone to consult where the revenue flows.


### Conclusion

The Threefold Foundation is building a global grid delivering IT capacity at competitive pricing. The token we issue will both jumpstart the rollout of this ThreeFold Grid and be used as a means of payment within the Grid. In order to increase price stability of the token, we aim to issue tokens whenever new operators join the ThreeFold Grid until the hard cap of 100 million tokens is reached. This results in a token that will remain spendable through the global grid maintained by the ThreeFold Foundation.
