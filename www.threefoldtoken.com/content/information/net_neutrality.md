**Yesterday**
The Internet started as global network comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operated without a central governing body. Universities, research institutions and governments agreed to collaborate on projects and share information.

**Today**
The Internet reaches billions of people and serves as global collaborative platform for business and personal benefit. But 80% of all of the Internet capacity is created by a handful of giant companies concentrated in and around the US, Europe and China. Monopolies arise.

**Tomorrow**
GIG drives net-neutrality by creating and distributing technology that enables a secure, scalable and self-healing Internet for everyone. This capacity is generated with our partners that are distributed in many thousands of locations.
