We designed the TF Token as a safe, scalable currency with real utility and intrinsic value backed by real assets. 

One of the Foundation’s primary goals is to migrate the TF Token firmly into the mainstream as both a payment mechanism used to purchase IT and other services and a safe investment alternative for traditional investors.  To do this, the Foundation prioritizes the TF Token’s liquidity, stability, transparency and exchangeability - as these metrics heavily influence acceptance and demand for digital (and fiat) currencies. 

These attributes make TF Tokens very trusted attractive for investors and users as Token Holders benefit from the following:

* Real Intrinsic Value.  The Tokens are backed with full economic interests in the Foundation and the Foundation’s assets.  Furthermore the Foundation grows organically by investing in revenue-generating assets  - increasing the Foundation’s value
* Commercial Utility.  From inception, TF Tokens have a specific designated use as the payment mechanism for buying and selling IT capacity on the TF Grid.
* Price Support and Stability.  The Token’s utility and diversified Token Holder base facilitates liquidity by supporting daily trading volumes and market price discovery 
* Reputational and System Integrity. TF Tokens benefit from robust reputational and technological protections generating trust amongst Token Holders

### Real Intrinsic Value - TF Tokens are Backed  with Real Assets
One of the key differentiating characteristics of the TF Token vis-a-vis other cryptocurrencies is that the TF Token has intrinsic value backed by real assets.  The value of most other crypto-currencies is based on speculation and is not supported by underlying assets or collateral.  This includes the largest and most well-known crypto-currency, Bitcoin (and many fiat currencies as well for that matter…).

TF Tokens are backed by real assets.  Each Token represents a pro rata economic interest in the Foundation, meaning the Tokens benefit from the full value of the Foundation - much like a share of a company.  The Underlying Assets of the Foundation include the Internet infrastructure and capacity deployed by the Foundation, the cash flows of the Foundation (continuously re-invested in more infrastructure), the Foundation’s open-source IP assets and the cash (or equivalent value) exchanged for the Tokens.

Furthermore, the TF Alliance (Foundation) expects to be very profitable and grow its cash flows rapidly. The Foundation plans to have a similar growth and cash flow profile to other leading tech and cloud computing companies.   The Foundation believes the TF Token valuation should reflect the Foundation’s future growth and profit potential - in line with the valuation multiples of peer companies. TF Token Holders of course, have a full economic interest in this valuation 

### Commercial Utility - TF Tokens Are Designated Payment Mechanism for IT Capacity

What do we mean when we say our Token has a specific “utility?”  We mean that our Token has a designated “use” as the preferred payment mechanism for buying and selling Internet capacity on our grid.  We believe that commercial utility is critical long term for a currency.

 Though crypto-currencies are gaining acceptance as an acceptable form of payment for goods and services, most digital coins are still held mainly for investment and other reasons.  The TF Token is different, as it has a specific immediate real utility - as the designated payment mechanism for IT Capacity transactions.  Over time, the Foundation’s objective is for the TF Token to become the preferred currency for IT capacity transactions - scaling with the growth of the Internet.
 
This utility creates unique benefits for Token Holders.  Because purchasers of IT capacity are not in the business of investing in digital coins - and they need to use TF Tokens to pay for their IT capacity - this results in additional transaction activity, higher  daily trading volumes and better price discovery for TF Token Holders - all of which should enhance the attractiveness of TF Tokens vis-a-vis other digital coins.

Furthermore, Internet capacity is among the fastest growing commodities in the world - and linking the Token directly to the value of IT Capacity provides further support and stability for the Token.  The exchange rate used for TF Tokens vs IT capacity is calculated dynamically via an algorithmic pricing model


### Price Support and Stability - TF Tokens Benefit from Additional Liquidity and Demand
Our Tokens are supported by a number of tools and mechanisms including the following:

* Growing Value of the Foundation.  The Foundation invests the proceeds of the ICO in cash flow generative assets.  These cash flows are expected to grow organically over time - increasing the value of the Foundation (just like a technology growth company).  Because each TF Token represents a pro rata interest in the Foundation, TF Token’s benefit from this increasing intrinsic value  
* Create additional demand by designating TF Tokens as the payment mechanism for TF Grid.  The TF Token will be the payment mechanism for IT Capacity transactions generating additional demand for Tokens
* Increase average daily trading volumes and improve price discovery.  The additional daily trading generated by “Token for IT capacity” transactions increases trading volumes facilitating better price discovery and support
* Diversify the TF Token Holder base beyond traditional Coin investors.  Importantly, the purchasers of IT capacity are not typical Digital Coin investors so this additional demand will also diversify the TF Token Holder base more broadly than typical cryptocurrencies 
* Hold minimum Cash and Token reserves on balance sheet.  The Foundation will maintain a minimum cash balance as well as a minimum balance of Tokens held in treasury to be used to address any liquidity or price stability issues that may arise 

### Trustworthiness - TF Tokens Benefit from Robust Reputational and Technological Protections
To ensure full system integrity, we safeguarded the Token in a number of key ways including the following: 

* Robust Onboarding protocols for Token Holders.  Through its TF App, the Foundation employs robust onboarding protocols and identity management for Token Holders ensuring compliance with Know Your Client and Anti-Money Laundering rules. 
* Itsyou.online Identity management.  All Token Holders are authenticated via itsyou.online with  3 level of verification: SMS, Address and Email
* Secure Blockchain infrastructure.  The Rivine.io blockchain is a distributed, “proof of stake” blockchain running on highly efficient green infrastructure.
