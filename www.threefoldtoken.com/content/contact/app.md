Dear ThreeFold Foundation member, to make onboarding easier we developed the ThreeFold App, available on both the Apple store and Google play.

Just download the ThreeFold App on your mobile device, and log in using your ItsYou.Online credentials. This allows you to easily remain up to date with latest news and contact us with any questions you may have.
To access investor functionality, you need a referral code. Please contact the person who introduced you to ThreeFold.

If you have any questions or problems with the ThreeFold App please reach out to us using the messaging function on our website or app. We will make sure to get back to you as soon as possible.
