# SUMMARY OFFERING TERMS

## What is a ThreeFold Token?

- The ThreeFold Foundation is the issuer of the Tokens.
- The Tokens represent an economic interest in the ThreeFold Foundation and are backed by the full faith and credit of the Foundation and all of the Foundationâ€™s assets

## Price per Token

The ITO price is $5 per Token.

Without consent from the Foundation, Internal Token Offering investors will not be allowed to sell their Tokens for a period of six months after the original investment.

## Target Amount

We are issuing up to 1,000,000 Tokens for the Internal Token Offering (ITO).

## Use of Proceeds for the ITO

The Foundation will use the net proceeds of the ITO for working capital and to deploy Operator capacity on our Grid and for PTO-related expenses.

## Convertible Note Terms

## What is the process to buy tokens?

ITO Tokens can be purchased via our TF App.  The process is very straightforward - exactly like a friends and family venture capital investment round.

You can invest using Bitcoin or by wire transfer to our bank account.

## Disclaimer

We do everything possible to protect your purchase of Tokens, we do this by making sure we work with the right legal partner (Orrick) as well as making sure that all our procedures are 100% transparent. We use a blockchain as well as paper documentation to make sure that all ITO investments are registered in the most secure way.

You will have full insight on budgets of the Foundation and all progress we are making.
We want to be a teal organization (means 100% transparent organization, more info soon).

We always want to keep 12 months of cash buffer in the Foundation and we will make sure that the burnrate of the Foundation itself is low. Our team is paid in ThreeFold Tokens. The internet capacity is deployed through specially created legal vehicles which again operate in 100% transparency. 

We will work hard to support Tokens but we want you to realize that such an investment is never without risk. We are a startup and as such while we have all best intentions we cannot guarantee that Token prices will always be higher than at the point when you bought them.
