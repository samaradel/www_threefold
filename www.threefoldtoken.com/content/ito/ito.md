# Timeline

Our Initial Token Offering (ITO) will run through September 2017, or as soon as an amount corresponding to 5 million USD has been received from ITO investors, whichever occurs first.  
After that the price for Tokens will increase (as indicated below).  
We plan our Public Token Offering for Q4 2017

# SUMMARY OFFERING TERMS

## What is a ThreeFold Token?

- A ThreeFold Token is a smart contract digital token (the Token) that is the exclusive payment instrument or currency for which operators can sell IT capacity via our Directory service. 
 - ThreeFold operators sell their capacity for  Tokens, ThreeFold users buy capacity with Tokens.
   
- The ThreeFold Foundation is the issuer of the Tokens. 
- The Tokens represent an economic interest in the ThreeFold Foundation and are backed by the full faith and credit of the Foundation and all of the Foundationâ€™s assets

## Price per Token

The ITO price is a 50% discount to the Token price in our public token offering (PTO). 
We expect the starting PTO price to be USD 10 per Token - so the ITO price would be USD 5 per Token.

## Lock-up Period

Without consent from the Foundation, Internal Token Offering investors will not be allowed to sell their Tokens for a period of six months after the original investment.


## Target Amount

We are issuing up to 1,000,000 Tokens for the Internal Token Offering (ITO).

## Use of Proceeds for the ITO

The Foundation will use the net proceeds of the ITO for working capital and to deploy Operator capacity on our Grid and for PTO-related expenses.

## Convertible Note Terms

Your investment in Tokens will take the form of a convertible note in BetterToken BVBA (our onboarding vehicle in Belgium).  At the time of the Threefold Public Token Offering, the note will be convertible into TF Tokens.

The convertible note will have the following terms:

- Maturity: 1 year
- Coupon: 2% non-cash, accruing
- Optional Conversion:  optional conversion by the Investor into TF Tokens at the time of the Threefold Foundation Public Token Offering
- Conversion Price:  The note will convert into Tokens at a price equal to 50% of the public token offering price.  We expect the PTO to be priced at USD 10 per Token - so ITO investors would convert at USD 5.

## What is the process to buy tokens?

You can invest using Bitcoin or Ether or by wire transfer to our bank account.

## Disclaimer

We do everything possible to protect your purchase of Tokens, we do this by making sure we work with the right legal partner (Orrick) as well as making sure that all our procedures are 100% transparent. We use a blockchain as well as paper documentation to make sure that all ITO investments are registered in the most secure way.

You will have full insight on budgets of the Foundation and all progress we are making.
We want to be a teal organization (means 100% transparent organization, more info soon).

We always want to keep 12 months of cash buffer in the Foundation and we will make sure that the burnrate of the Foundation itself is low. Our team is paid in ThreeFold Tokens. The internet capacity is deployed through specially created legal vehicles which again operate in 100% transparency. 

We will work hard to support Tokens but we want you to realize that such an investment is never without risk. We are a startup and as such while we have all best intentions we cannot guarantee that Token prices will always be higher than at the point when you bought them.
