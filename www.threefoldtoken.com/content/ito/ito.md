# Timeline

Our Internal Token Offering (ITO) will run until an amount corresponding to 5 million USD has been received from ITO token sales.  
After that the price for Tokens will increase.  
We plan our Public Token Offering for December 2017.

# SUMMARY OFFERING TERMS

## What is a ThreeFold Token?

- A ThreeFold Token is a smart contract digital token (the Token) that is the exclusive payment instrument or currency for which operators can sell Internet IT capacity via our Directory service - ThreeFold operators sell their capacity for Tokens, ThreeFold users buy capacity with Tokens.

- The ThreeFold Foundation will be the issuer of the Tokens.

## What is a ThreeFold iToken?

- iTokens are precursors to the ThreeFold Token. They are currently issued by Green IT Globe Holdings FZC, and will be converted to ThreeFold Tokens at the public launch on a 1-for-1 basis.
- For now, we only sell iTokens.

## Price per (i)Token

The ITO price is $5 per (i)Token.

## Lock-up Period

Without consent from the Foundation, Internal Token Offering investors will not be allowed to sell their (i)Tokens for a period of six months after the original investment.

## Target Amount

We are issuing up to 1,000,000 (i)Tokens for the Internal Token Offering (ITO).

## Use of Proceeds for the ITO

The Foundation will use the net proceeds of the ITO for working capital and to deploy Operator capacity on our Grid and for PTO-related expenses.

## Utility of iTokens

Purchased iTokens are endowed with immediate utility for purchasing Internet IT capacity through our partners and on our Grid. Contact us for more details.

## What is the process to buy tokens?

ITO Tokens can be purchased via our TF App.  The process is very straightforward - exactly like a friends and family venture capital investment round.

You will need to:
1. download the app, available on both the [Apple store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1276543091) and [Google play](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mobicage.rogerthat.em.be.threefold.token)
2. register on ItsYou.online 
3. ask the person who introduced you to ThreeFold for their referral code and enter it in the app

You can invest using Bitcoin or by wire transfer to our bank account. You can invite friends using the app, and see your own referral code in the app using the "invite friends" button.

## Disclaimer

We do everything possible to protect your purchase of (i)Tokens, we do this by making sure we work with the right legal partner (Orrick) as well as making sure that all our procedures are 100% transparent. We use a blockchain as well as paper documentation to make sure that all ITO transactions are registered in the most secure way.

You will have full insight on budgets of the Foundation and all progress we are making.
We want to be a teal organization (means 100% transparent organization).

We always want to keep 12 months of cash buffer in the Foundation and we will make sure that the burnrate of the Foundation itself is low. Our team is paid in ThreeFold Tokens. The internet capacity is deployed through specially created legal vehicles which again operate in 100% transparency.

We will work hard to support Tokens but we want you to realize that such an investment is never without risk. We are a startup and as such while we have all best intentions we cannot guarantee that Token prices will always be higher than at the point when you bought them.
