Digital currencies are well on the way to full acceptance as a mainstream currency in the future - providing significant benefits such as direct peer to peer transactions, greater trust secured by cryptography and mathematics and no single point of failure.

However, major problems remain such as a lack of scalability, impossible energy requirements, certain perceived reputational issues - and most importantly, a general absence of intrinsic value (ie backing by real assets) and limited use of digital currencies to buy goods and services (ie utility).
