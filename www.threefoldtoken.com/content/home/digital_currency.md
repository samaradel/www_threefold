Digital currencies are well on the way to full acceptance as a mainstream currency in the future - providing significant benefits such as direct peer to peer transactions, greater trust secured by cryptography and mathematics; lower charges; faster transactions and no single point of failure.

However, major problems remain such as scalability issues, slow transaction times, impossible energy requirements, reputational issues, no identity management -
and most importantly, a general absence of intrinsic value backed by real assets.
