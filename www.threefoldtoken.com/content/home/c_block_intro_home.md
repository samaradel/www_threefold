**Stateless Computing:** is based on our own operating system, [Zero-OS](https://github.com/zero-os), a lightweight OS that powers thousands of hardware nodes to form a grid of edge cloud and storage capacity.

**Self-Healing Awareness** is driven by [Jumpscale](https://github.com/Jumpscale): we strive for zero manual intervention, relying on autonomous agent driven services instead.

**Blockchain Technology** will be used to protect identity and access control via [itsyou.online](https://github.com/itsyouonline). [Threefold Tokens](/) are initially deployed on Ethereum while we finish work on our own open-source, secure and scalable [Rivine](https://github.com/rivine/rivine) blockchain implementation.

These three connecting elements are the foundation of a pervasive, neutral, private and affordable Internet that operates and enables connection without any central governing body or large corporate company.
