We develop different business models based on a flexible dual-license model. This allows us to enable both our commercial partners with technology integration and professional services to run high volume cloud businesses, as well as nonprofit organizations looking for open-source benefits.

Our open-source tech addresses all scalability, security, storage, energy and operating issues without the need for any 3rd party software and without no complexity at all. This is driving down the cost, while providing better accessibility to Internet applications and cloud infrastructure.
