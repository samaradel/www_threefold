The need for Internet IT capacity is growing extremely fast and new centralized hyper scale datacenters cannot cope with this demand as the requirements for power and funding are too big.  

The Foundation believes the solution to this $trillion problem is the migration of IT capacity to the “Edge” close to where the users of the internet are. Today less than 20 big corporations in the world own more than 80% of the internet IT capacity, resulting in inequalities.

Over the last +10 years we have developed a technology which allows IT to be like a real utility,
consuming up to 10 times less energy and 100% self healing without involvement of IT specialists.

Threefold wants to deploy capacity super local to the users
and funded by all of us by means of a new digital currency.
