ThreeFold Foundation is proud to announce the first 4 Farming Cooperatives.
Farming Cooperatives are here to make farming accessible to anybody, anywhere in the world.
Through them people can purchase your own pre-installed hardware to farm at home, or go for the option to let them get their hands "dirty" cultivating hardware in a datacenter making it possible to farm with 0 tech experience.
