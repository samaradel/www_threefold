# HOW TO GET STARTED

Please make sure you read our [Idea page](/) first.

## How to become part of our movement.

As a first step please download the first version of the Threefold app. It is available on both the [Apple store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1276543091) and [Google play](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mobicage.rogerthat.em.be.threefold.token). 

The app will keep you updated on latest developments through its News service.

In the future, the app allow you to become a member of our organization, become a hoster and purchase our tokens.
