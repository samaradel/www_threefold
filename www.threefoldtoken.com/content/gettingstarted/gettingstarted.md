## News

Status

* We have (verbal) commitments for about 2m USD now (we would like to get to 5m USD)
* We have confirmation of about 30 ambassadors (we would like to get to at least 50)
* We have about 120 hosters for our blockchain (we need at least 80 more)

The first version of the Threefold app is ready! It is available on both the [Apple store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1276543091) and [Google play](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mobicage.rogerthat.em.be.threefold.token).

In the future we will use this app to replace above news groups.
It will be used for 
    - our hosters (onboarding, shipping, acceptance, ...)
    - our investors (automatically created contracts)
    - to sign & distribute the contracts and terms & conditions
    - to communicate (chat & news)


Open issues we are working on

* We need Orrick to check all the legal documents again & make sure we are in order with the SEC rules about securities
* We need oral confirmation for at least 200 hosters (we have the hardware ready to be shipped)
* more tech info about the technology
* more info about the business case for capacity
* start populating the pages for ambassadors & hosters
* create a better budget & make transparent
* create an article about how the foundation will be run (as teal organization)
* link to GIG website (the technology)
