# SUMMARY TOKEN SALE TERMS
The Tokens purchased in this private token offering will provide the purchasers with access to our Grid and Directory service, and will also allow purchasers of the Tokens to participate in our mission of building a new neutral internet.

## Private Token Offering (PTO)

We are organizing our Private Token Offering (PTO) to raise additional capital to deploy more infrastructure and capacity on our Grid.  The Foundation is issuing ThreeFold Tokens to a limited number of identified individuals and legal entities via our Token Issuance Mechanism (explained below).

## ThreeFold Token

A digital token (the Token) that is the exclusive payment instrument or currency for which operators can sell IT capacity via our Directory service.

## The Issuer

The ThreeFold Foundation, a transparent tokenized organization. The Foundation’s long term objective is to migrate our Token firmly into the mainstream as a currency used to purchase IT and other services. The envisaged way to achieve this is by creating a virtuous cycle: Token sales help grow a global grid of IT capacity, and the global grid supports the use of the Token. The assets of the Foundation include:
- Internet infrastructure assets (our Grid)
- The cash flows generated by the Foundation’s assets
- The IT Capacity available for sale for which the Tokens are used as payment mechanism


## Designated Utility - payment currency for Internet Capacity:

Our Tokens are the designated payment mechanism for IT Capacity sold via our Directory service on our global Grid.  
Over time, the Foundation’s objective is for our Tokens to become the preferred currency for IT capacity transactions - scaling with the growth of the Internet.

## Available Amount Of Tokens

Today there are 10,000,000 Tokens created, in keeping with the internet capacity which is committed to be deployed by our operators and hosters over more than 200 locations. 

## Token Issuance Mechanism and Price per Token

We will use the majority of the PTO proceeds to invest in infrastructure and capacity on our Grid.  Given the attractive economics of our infrastructure, the value of our Grid and our Foundation potentially  increases based on the amount of investment we deploy.  Accordingly, our Token price will could be expected to increase based on the amount of funding we raise.  

We are organizing our Private Token Offering (PTO) to raise additional capital to deploy more capacity on our Grid. We plan to issue a variable number of tokens, but only at ever increasing prices. Formally, there is no target amount.

## Price per Unit

US$ 10.00 per Token for the first 1 million tokens, initially increasing by US$ 2 for every 1 million sold.

After 6 million tokens have sold in this way, implying all tokens priced up to US$ 20.00 per token have been sold, we slightly change the increase per 1 million tokens sold. The price increase per 1 million tokens then becomes equal to 10% of the price of the previous batch (rounded down to US$ 0.10). In other words, after the US$ 20.00 batch, the next batch is priced at US$ 22.00, the one after that at US$ 24.20, the next will be at US$ 26.60, and so on.

After December 2019, at the discretion of both governing boards, the above system of continuous issuance at ever increasing prices can remain in place as is, or it can be adjusted and, possibly, stopped.

## Currencies Accepted

Initially, we accept USD, EUR, GBP and BTC.
At a later stage, we will open up YEN, UAED, CHF and ETH.

## Use of Proceeds

The Foundation will use the net proceeds of the PTO to deploy additional Internet capacity on our global Grid (at least 60% and grows to 90% over time).  
Part of the proceeds of the PTO will be held as cash on balance sheet to support Token liquidity.

Importantly, the Foundation’s Internet infrastructure generates cash flows from the sale of the internet capacity being created- the Foundation expects to continue to fund the growth of the Grid network with the excess cash generated by the sale of capacity and the sale of additional Tokens to purchasers of capacity.

The Foundation reinvests all these profits – as a charitable Foundation, there are no management fees or profits or any other benefits returned to shareholders or management.

## Smart Contract

The Tokens are issued electronically via smart contract consisting of software code, existing on the Foundation’s chosen Blockchain (Smart Contract).

## Trading

The Tokens will be tradable on the Foundation’s private exchange.


## Foundation Governance and Management

The Foundation will be structured as a Dutch Stichting based in the Dutch Antilles.
Our legal & financial structure has been setup by "Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe" which is one of the leading law firms in the world.

The Foundation is governed and represented by its Boards of Directors.  The Boards ensure that the Foundation’s activities are aligned with its stated purpose and benefit the Token Holders.  There are 2 levels of boards to ensure transparency for Token Holders. For detailled information see: [Our Foundation's Governance ](/governance)

The Foundation has a management team appointed by the Board. The management team oversees daily operations and is highly experienced across technology, growth businesses and Finance. Members of our team have successfully built and exited numerous technology start-ups and several have extensive C-Level experience in high profile companies.

## Reinvestment of Cash Flows

All cashflow generated by the Foundation will be re-invested, increasing the asset value of the Foundation and the Tokens. Hence the value and financial benefit generated by the Foundation accrues to the Tokens.


## Offering Expenses

We currently plan to reserve 5% of the proceeds from the sale of Tokens to cover expenses of the offering (legal, accounting and advisory costs) as well as any commissions required.

## WHY SHOULD YOU BUY OUR TOKENS?

- Good cause: Purchasers are helping us build a new neutral edge Internet
- Potential upside: ThreeFold sits at the intersection of three of today’s most important technologies - Blockchain, Cloud - Computing and Artificial Intelligence, and we believe that as our global Grid expands and the capacity available for sale grows, the demand for our Tokens will increase
- Downside Protection and reduced volatility (ie Token price less likely to decrease substantially): Our Technology and Grid are already up and running and we believe our Foundation and its assets represent significant value
- High quality team with extensive technology and financial experience
- Existing technology that is very well positioned for Edge networking and outperforms leading technologies in many categories
