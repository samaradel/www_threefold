# SUMMARY TOKEN SALE TERMS
The Tokens purchased in this public token offering will provide the purchasers with access to our Grid and Directory service, and will also allow purchasers of the Tokens to participate in our mission of building a new neutral internet. 

## ThreeFold Token

A smart contract digital token (the Token) that is the exclusive payment instrument or currency for which operators can sell IT capacity via our Directory service. 

## Backing / Collateral

The Token represents an economic interest in the ThreeFold Foundation.  Our Foundation’s by-laws state that if the Foundation ceases, Token Holders would receive 100% of the resulting distributable assets as determined by the Foundation’s administrators.
The assets of the Foundation include:
- Internet infrastructure assets ( our Grid)
- The cash flows generated by the Foundation’s assets
- The Foundation’s open source technology (software)
- The IT Capacity available for sale for which the Tokens are used as payment mechanism
  

## The Issuer

The ThreeFold Foundation, a transparent tokenized organization with three primary objectives:  
- Using our Token to build a new, neutral, “Edge” Internet,
- Creating a safe digital currency with real utility backed by real assets and
- Empowering our Token Holders to work alongside us

## Designated Utility - payment currency for Internet Capacity:

Our Tokens are the designated payment mechanism for IT Capacity sold via our Directory service on our global Grid.  
Over time, the Foundation’s objective is for our Tokens to become the preferred currency for IT capacity transactions - scaling with the growth of the Internet

## Available Amount Of Tokens 

Today there are 10,000,000 Tokens created and backed by internet capacity which is committed to be deployed by our operators and hosters over more than 200 locations.


## Target Amount Offered

We are organizing our Public Token Offering (PTO) to raise additional capital to deploy more capacity on our Grid.  We plan to issue up to 3,000,000 Tokens raising US $30 million of proceeds  

## Price per Unit

US$ 10.00 per Token

## Currencies Accepted

USD, YEN, EUR, GBP, CHF, BTC and ETH

## Use of Proceeds

The Foundation will use the net proceeds of the PTO to deploy additional Internet capacity on our global Grid.  Part of the proceeds of the PTO will be held as cash on balance sheet to support Token liquidity

Importantly, the Foundation’s Internet infrastructure generates cash flows from the sale of the internet capacity being created- the Foundation expects to continue to fund the growth of the Grid network with the excess cash generated by the sale of capacity and the sale of additional Tokens to purchasers of capacity.
  
The Foundation reinvests these profits – as a charitable Foundation, there are no stockholders of the Foundation

## Smart Contract

The Tokens are issued electronically via smart contract consisting of software code, existing on the Foundation’s chosen Blockchain (Smart Contract). 

## Listing

The Tokens will be listed on multiple digital currency exchanges.

## Follow-on Token Offerings

The Foundation may issue new Tokens via follow-on Token Offerings to make further investments in Internet capacity on our global Grid and will from time to time sell Tokens to purchasers of Grid internet capacity.

## Foundation Governance and Management

The Foundation will be structured as a Dutch Stichting Trust based in the Dutch Antilles. 
Our legal & financial structure has been setup by "Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe" which is one of the leading law firms in the world.

The Foundation is governed and represented by its Boards of Directors.  The Boards ensure that the Foundation’s activities are aligned with its stated purpose and benefit the Token Holders.  There are 3 levels of boards to ensure transparency for Token Holders  [see this doc](http://www.threefoldtoken.com/governance)

The Foundation has a management team appointed by the Board. The management team oversees daily operations and is highly experienced across technology, growth businesses and Finance. Members of our team have successfully built and exited numerous technology start-ups and several have extensive C-Level experience in high profile companies.

## Reinvestment of Cash Flows

Because the Foundation does not have any stockholders, all of the value and financial benefit generated by the Foundation is allocated to the Tokens. All cashflow generated by the Foundation will be re-invested, increasing the asset value of the Foundation and the Tokens.

## Liquidation Rights

Per the Foundation by-laws, in the event the Foundation ceases, the  full Net Asset Value of the Foundation as determined at the time would be distributed to the then holders of the Tokens.

## Offering Expenses

We currently plan to reserve 5% of the proceeds from the sale of Tokens to cover expenses of the offering (legal, accounting and advisory costs) as well as any commissions required.

## WHY SHOULD YOU BUY OUR TOKENS?

- Good cause: Purchasers are helping us build a new neutral edge Internet
- Potential upside: ThreeFold sits at the intersection of three of today’s most important technologies - Blockchain, Cloud - Computing and Artificial Intelligence, and we believe that as our global Grid expands and the capacity available for sale grows, the demand for our Tokens will increase
- Downside Protection and reduced volatility (ie Token price less likely to decrease substantially):  Our Tokens are backed by the full faith and credit and assets of our Foundation.  Our Technology and Grid are already up and running and we believe our Foundation and its assets represent significant value
- High quality team with extensive technology and financial experience
- Existing technology that is very well positioned for Edge networking and outperforms leading technologies in many categories
