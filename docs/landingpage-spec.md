## WHY A NEW NEUTRAL EDGE INTERNET
The need for Internet IT capacity is growing fast, in both the number of users around the globe and more connected devices in already established regions. Current architecture hyper scale datacenters will not be able to cope with this demand as the requirements for power and funding are too big.  

The Foundation believes the solution to this trillion dollar problem is the migration of IT capacity to the “Edge”, close to where the users of the internet are. Today’s infrastructure is heavily centralized: less than 20 big corporations in the world own more than 80% of the internet IT capacity, resulting in inequalities in distribution.

Over the last +10 years we have developed a technology which allows IT to behave much like a real utility, consuming up to 10 times less energy and 100% self healing without involvement of IT specialists.

Threefold wants to deploy capacity in this new paradigm local to the users where needed, managed by smaller clusters, and funded by all of us by means of a new digital currency.

## WHY A NEW DIGITAL CURRENCY
Decentralized digital currencies are here to stay, due to their significant benefits such as direct peer to peer transactions, immutability of transactions as secured by cryptography and mathematics and the absence of a single point of failure that decentralized protocols bring.

However, major problems remain such as a lack of scalability, impossible energy requirements, certain perceived reputational issues - and most importantly, a general absence of intrinsic value (ie backing by real assets) and limited use of digital currencies to buy goods and services (ie utility).

## Our Dream

We live in very interesting times, the world has never changed so quickly. 
We want to help at the positive side and help the world to become a better place. 

The Foundation has 3 focal points
Green & Power Efficient Internet

by changing the way how the internet is expanding and by building a more efficient grid, we save tremendous amounts of energy up to 10x times.
Education & Equal Chances

by providing internet capacity all over the world close to the users, we improve performance and allow anyone to get access to the required resources for their business or education at affordable prices
A Safe Utility Currency

 digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are super popular, but they are not backed by assets and very speculative, together we want to create the safest, greenest and most stable digital currency in the world.
We want to empower anyone to become part of the Threefold Foundation and work with us to accomplish our objectives. The Foundation is a 100% transparent tokenized organization driven by a strong set of values. You can join us by buying & using tokens - or become one of our Hosters or Operators.
