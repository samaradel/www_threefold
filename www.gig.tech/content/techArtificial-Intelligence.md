### What is Artificial Intelligence?

GIG develops open-source software, Zero-OS, for the deployment of bare machines functioning as Internet nodes and application hosts.

Zero-OS creates the ideal compute platform to run containerized applications and software code on secure and high-available IT infrastructure.

Zero-OS can be deployed by anyone that is willing to make server and storage capacity available in their markets and within the GIG network.
