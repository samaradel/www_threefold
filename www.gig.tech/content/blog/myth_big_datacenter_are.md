### Myth 1: big data centers are more efficient than small ones.

There are advantages in building large scale data centers like economies of scale and shear bulk buying power compared to small ones but these are not as big as people think. The average cost per rack in a hyper scale data center is 20-35K USD including all energy &amp; safety systems. The cost of the hardware per rack is around the 200-300k USD mark.

What is often forgotten is that anything that is of enormous scale and therefore highly concentrated or dense brings complexity and a specific set of problems to deal with. This adds resource requirements like investment, operational costs, knowledge and people.

In IT world often things are made more complex than they should.

In reality keeping things simple &amp; small is much more cost effective than a big complex environment. So creating a hyper scale data center presents a very interesting challenge and there are specialist companies to help build and solve problems along the way but it is not the most cost effective way to deliver data center services.

### Myth 2: big data center can be made green.

If you throw in all assets needed to build a big data center - land, real estate and all required hardware, power and staff- it leaves a huge carbon footprint. Power a data center with wind, hydro or solar power and use technology to improve the PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) of a data center helps to reduce the overall carbon footprint. This is the strategy that most data center operators have adopted to decrease their carbon footprint and write about this in their corporate social responsibility.

A 20% reduction in the PUE factor of a data center sounds like big deal but it's still an improvement in the overhead power consumption. Improvements are mostly sought and found in the actual cooling technology of a data center or by sourcing zero carbon footprint power sources. What is hardly ever looked it is the actual power consumed by the equipment that runs the IT workloads inside these data center. Actual servers, storage chassis, physical disks, switch farms and tape libraries.

These devices make up 100% it the real carbon footprint of a data center while the PUE only speaks about the overhead power consumption to cool the facility, to open and close the doors of the facility and the security systems that keep the bad people out and the good people in.

The real improvement lies in deploying technologies that actually consume less power to deliver the actual IT capacity to run the workloads, real CPU chassis, physical disks and storage cabinets. Working on how hardware is being more effectively used can have an impact of 1000% and lead to 10 times more power efficiency. More info see this blog.

### Myth 3: redundant systems have a better uptime?

This is how all of us (of age ;-) have been raised. Systems need redundancy mechanisms to improve their operational uptime and reliability. And to be honest if you look at it for a minutes this seems to make a lot of sense…. if you are looking at it through IT tainted glasses. But translate this to the non IT World: Simple example:

In order to make your car more reliable we add redundancy as we do in IT. So for the risk of having a puncture we add one extra tire for all the tires we use continuously. This adds 4 extra tires to the car. Then a decision needs to be made: Do we put those tires in a structure where they are always running along the primary tires or do we chose not to have them "on line" all the time and wearing and tearing as the primary tires? To have them on line continuously is inefficient and wasteful and therefore we need to built a very complicated structure that puts the tires on the road the second (more accurate microsecond) that the car detects a tire puncture. To build this system which adds high availability to a car is definitely an engineering challenge that would keep a (large) number of engineers (electronic, hydraulic, mechanical and computer) busy for awhile and I am sure that all of them would come up with a working solution. But…..

This solution would add a lot of complexity, would change the the look and feel of a car completely, would add a lot of unnecessary petrol to overcome the extra drag and so and so on. Also would you feel comfortable to run this car down the motorway at 100 miles an hour and have to risk of it putting down four extra tires? I don't think so and in reality this has not been done for mainstream transportation - for certain specialty vehicles we have invented tires that cannot deflated, thereby solving the issue in the simplest possible manner. Solve the root cause.

The IT industry has gone mental with the concept of everything needs to be built and expanded to create redundancy, it forgot somehow to look  at root causes which helped spawning a whole new industry of itself, that obviously want to keep themselves in the business of creating complicated and expensive redundant system. A self fulfilling prophecy But has it actually made IT system more reliable?

### Myth 4: big companies know better how to optimize.

'''Big companies with a certain track record will know better how to optimize, they have more people…'''

At first sight this sounds logical but still if we look at the IT landscape today 90%+ of innovation in IT is done by small startups. The big legacy IT companies have a huge heritage they hardly can overcome. They are locked in old infrastructure designs and after a while the build out of the infrastructure becomes the brake for their business. Real innovation dies a slows death and in comes the pain killer approach.

When companies come of size red tape enters the structure and innovation comes to a halt. Maintaining the status quo operationally, building brand, improving the bottom line are the new tactical goals that are redefined every financial year. Innovation and R&amp;D budgets shrink and the technology marginally improves to be able to have annual announcements.

Obviously this is a very negative view of large established companies, but to a degree we all recognize the difficulties to achieve real change in such large enterprises. On the contrary small startup of even scale up companies are agile, have an overall.

The innovation to overcome these hurdles is mostly blocked internally by the established power houses. Startups on the other hand are more keen to develop new things and have no history to deal with.
