Following values are very important to GIG:

### RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS

- Sustainable = green (our world needs all our help)
- Available for all: which also means affordable and not owned by a few giant companies
- Decentralized: make sure technology is available everywhere, as distributed as possible
- Open & inter-operable: allow technology to work together with open standards
- Accessible: easy to access, fast and everywhere in the world
- Secure & private: your privacy is a [Human Right](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/DigitalAge/Pages/DigitalAgeIndex.aspx)

### RESPECT HUMAN EFFORT

- Make sure technology is reliable and lasts longer (break the 5 years technology renewal cycle).
- Avoid complexity (KIS): no unnecessary complexity.
- LESS = MORE (do less to achieve more)
- Let people/companies work together in a 100% transparent way.

### RESPECT HUMAN EXPERIENCE

- Products should be ergonomic and easy to use
- Design should be global: don’t favor certain user groups
- Products should look good, it will give us a better feeling
- Transparent: sales, pricing, processes, …

Design your organizations so that your core values are respect for human rights, respect for human effort, and respect for human experience.
