### Growth of the Cloud

Today cloud computing is a $100+ billion industry powered by circa 100 large datacenters - mostly owned by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook. Experts such as Bell Labs and Cisco believe the capacity requirement in the next decade will dramatically outstrip existing infrastructure, requiring an additional 400 million servers or approximately 4000 new datacenters, at a cost of $250 million to $1 billion each.

The spectacular growth and advances of cloud computing that occurred over the last decade resulted in large part from “hyperscale” efficiencies, centralising Internet infrastructure in very large $ billion data centers. Today demand for Internet capacity is far outstripping the available infrastructure due to new applications like Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence. The existing hyperscale cloud architecture cannot cope with this outsize demand as the requirements for land, power and funding are just too great.
