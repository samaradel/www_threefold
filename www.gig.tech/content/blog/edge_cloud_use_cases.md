### Any Docker Service

Zero-OS generates a network of stateless compute nodes that are perfect hosts for native containers, such as the Docker software platform. Zero-OS running as edge cloud offers much more than simply being an efficient host for Docker, the most used container technology platform. What else?

* Improvements Secure Recipe: docker gets converted to a metadata description
* Dedupe: minimal storage overhead for dedupe as only 1/100 of storage required
* Thin provisioning: only files required to run will be fetched from the network
* Runs inside a Virtual DataCenter (VDC) = Seamless network integration over unlimited amount of sites
* Attach 0-Disks: can attach fast redundant virtual disks to dockers which maintain state
* Integrated in our Cockpit techno: self-driving techno using blueprints and smart contracts

### Infrastructure-as-a-Service

IaaS workloads run very efficiently on the edge cloud. Zero-OS and the edge cloud technology enables hardware capabilities to be used in a very efficient way. Overhead is reduced to a minimum by stripping out unnecessary layers of software that have been invented and implemented over the last decade to patch scaling, security and performance problems. At GIG we only look at solving root causes of IT issues using new algorithms, rather than patching fixes.

* **Less is more**: Zero-OS is eradicating the host-operating system for a virtualized solution to a minimum and make it boot over the network - no local operating system installed on hardware.
* **Software-centric** It is important to step away from existing hardware storage solutions that have a need for proprietary acceleration hardware. At GIG we endorse the use of affordable and efficient components with a 100% software-centric storage back-end. This allows us to overcome hardware failures without human intervention - creating a very efficient, reliable and performing storage platform that can operate as a standalone storage back-end.

The platform is secure by using a network boot mechanism taking out the possibility to change any locally installed OS files making it almost hack resistant. IaaS is traditionally runs in hyperscale datacenters, remote from the businesses using it. Zero-OS technology allows you to install, operate and run IaaS services close to your business locations operated by your local IT team = edge cloud.

### Archive

Data generation is growing exponentially. More data has been generated in the last 2 years than ever before. This data needs to be archived. The edge cloud creates storage and archiving capabilities by using standard hardware and has known interfaces available to use (S3, FTP, WebDav, CIFS and NFS). It supports version controlling of the archived data to keep all relevant changes without any limitation while using a small amount of actual storage capacity.

Data security and reliability are key aspects for any storage system. Our edge cloud technology allows all data to be compressed and encrypted if and when needed. The distributed character of the storage system enables site redundant storage algorithms to be deployed keeping large data volumes from being stored in a single location taking away the risk of data being stolen (physically) and that of a site outage leading to a data outage. The distributed character of the system is inline with the increasing spread of actual data generation. We have sensory equipment everywhere these days and the overhead of storing all that information in a few central places is enormous Data collection and storage happens once - reading data to use it for a particular workload happens many times.

### Data Mining

On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated silos, making sharing of data difficult. The distributed character of the edge cloud presents compute and storage capacity everywhere. This enables large data mining workloads to happen close to the source of the data. Data is stored in a distributed manner and therefore data mining can happen in a distributed manner as well.

Distributed compute capacity next to storage capabilities creates the possibility to create data mining operations on local storage (which makes it very fast and efficient) by coding data mining algorithms in programming languages like python, lua, javascript and golang. Data mining follows distributed data storage.
