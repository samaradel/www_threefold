## RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS

- Sustainable = green (our world needs some help)
- Available for all: which also means affordable, not owned by a big company with as purpose greed.
- Decentralized: make sure technology is available everywhere
- Open & interoperable: allow techno to work together in open way
- Accessible: easy to access, fast enough, everywhere in the world
- Secure & private: your privacy is a right

## RESPECT HUMAN EFFORT

- Make sure technology is reliable and lasts longer (no need to replace in 5 years).
- Avoid complexity (KIS): no unnecessary complexity.
- LESS = MORE (do less to achieve more)
- Let people/companies work together in a 100% transparent way.

## RESPECT HUMAN EXPERIENCE

- Products should be ergonomic & easy to use
- Design should be global: don’t favor certain user groups!
- Products should look good, it will give us a better feeling
- TRANSPARENT: sales, pricing, processes, …

Design your organizations so that your core values are respect for human rights, respect for human effort, and respect for human experience.
