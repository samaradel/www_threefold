### Why Stateless Computing?

The creation of a new Internet based on hundred of thousands of smaller and larger edge nodes needs a complete new operating system and a totally holistic approach to the functioning of the server and storage infrastructure. 

GIG has developed the open-source components, [Zero-OS](https://github.com/Zero-OS), for the deployment of bare machines functioning as Internet nodes and application hosts.

[Zero-OS](https://github.com/Zero-OS) creates the ideal compute platform to run containerized applications and software code on secure and high-available IT infrastructure.

[Zero-OS](https://github.com/Zero-OS) can be deployed by anyone that is willing to make server and storage capacity available in their markets and within the GIG network.

### Benefits of Stateless Computing

* **Performance**: lightweight OS without overhead for running bare-metal machines
* **Free**: finds the optimal performance of server & storage nodes at no cost 
* **Privacy**: no data footprint remains while workloads move from one node to another
* **Distributed**: capacity is generated without the need for datacenters: *At The Edge* 
* **High-available**: easy creation of clusters while applications run in fragmented segments
* **Portability**: moving software from one node to another within the grid is instant 
* **Secure**: open-source distributed software with transparent code. No security backdoors
* **Green**: energy-efficient OS resulting in very low node power consumption
