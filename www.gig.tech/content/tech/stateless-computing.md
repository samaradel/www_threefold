### Why Stateless Computing?

The creation of a new Internet based on hundred of thousands of small and larger edge nodes needs a complete new operating system. 

GIG has developed the open-source components, [Zero-OS](https://github.com/Zero-OS), for the deployment of bare machines functioning as Internet nodes and application hosts.

[Zero-OS](https://github.com/Zero-OS) creates the ideal compute platform to run containerized applications and software code on secure and high-available IT infrastructure.

[Zero-OS](https://github.com/Zero-OS) can be deployed by anyone that is willing to make server and storage capacity available in their markets and within the GIG network.

### Benefits of Stateless Computing

* **Fast**: realize the optimal performance of your server & storage infrastructure at no additional cost 
* **Privacy**: no data footprint is left on the nodes, processing of data is done in memory
* **Distributed**: capacity can be generated without the need for large datacenters: At The Edge... 
* **High-available**: easy creation of clustered nodes while applications can run in fragmented segments
* **Portability**: moving software from one node to another node within the grid is instant and fast 
* **Performance**: lightweight OS with lowest possible overhead in order to run bare-metal infrastructure
* **Secure**: open-source distributed software with transparent code and no security backdoors
* **Green**: lightweight OS with nearly no overhead
