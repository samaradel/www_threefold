### Autonomous and Self Healing Cloud

GIG uses autonomous agents that identify and configure available resource pools for users looking for compute time, storage disks and application hosts.

GIG has developed [Jumpscale](https://github.com/jumpscale) and [At Your Service](https://github.com/Jumpscale/ays9) (AYS) which allows the creation of blueprints to auto-deploy applications within the compute environment.

Robots are constantly checking the health and uptime of the infrastructure and runtime environments, guaranteeing performance & availability of customer's applications.

### Artificial Intelligence Benefits

* **Self Healing:** the platform regenerates when health issues are detected that cause downtime of the infrastructure and applications  
* **Intelligence:** agents capture all kinds of grid information in order to make intelligent decisions in provisioning the ideal host platform for software code and containerized applications
* **Lifecycle Management:** recording of the state of infrastructure and lifecycle management of running applications while robots have the ability to take necessary actions
* **Autoscaling:** the autonomous agents check performance of your applications and automatically scale accordingly to meet application and infrastructure service levels
