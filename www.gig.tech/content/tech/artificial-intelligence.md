### Autonomous and Self Healing

GIG uses autonomous agents to identify and prepare resource pools in function of users looking for compute environments and application hosts.

GIG has developed [Jumpscale](https://github.com/jumpscale) and [At Your Service](https://github.com/Jumpscale/ays9) (AYS) which allows the creation of blueprints to auto-deploy applications within the compute environment.

Robots are constantly checking the health and uptime of the infrastructure and runtime environments, guaranteeing performance & availability of applications.

### Artificial Intelligence Benefits

* **Self Healing:** the platform regenerates when health issues are detected that cause downtime for infrastructure and applications  
* **Intelligence:** agents capture information from the grid and make intelligent decisions to provide an ideal and optimal host environment for software code and containerized applications
* **Lifecycle Management:** the state of the infrastructure and the lifecycle of running applications are constantly checked and recorded.
* **Autoscaling:** the platform automatically scales to meet application and infrastructure performance
