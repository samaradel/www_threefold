### New Consensus Algorithms

GIG develops new blockchain algorithms based on proof of stake for validation purposes and turned this to [Rivine](https://github.com/rivine/rivine) open-source software.

GIG does not rely on third party software nor is GIG using real-world resources like computers and energy in an inefficient way to record the state of the network and apps onto a distributed ledger.

GIG has developed [Rivine](https://github.com/rivine/rivine) as blockchain technology, acting as platform foundation for a scalable, green and secure ledger for token distribution and for the execution of smart contracts.

The blockchain also embraces the use of tokens, acting as carriers of value and smart contracts and facilitating the payments for capacity and services.

Last but not least, Rivine is also the blockchain platform for our identity and access management platform, [itsyou.online](https://github.com/itsyouonline).


### Blockchain Benefits

* **Green:** our algorithms to reach consensus use a minimal amount of energy and electricity compared to other blockchain software and networks
* **Lowest possible** cost of transactions make it an efficient and fast payment system
* **Neutral:** state of the network and applications are recorded in a transparent and immutable manner
* **Payment fulfillment:** transactions are automatically paid using ThreeFold Tokens.
* **Smart Contracts:** fully automated execution of contracts from customers buying IT capacity.
