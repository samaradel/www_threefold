**Stateless Computing:** is based on our unique operating system, [Zero-OS](https://github.com/zero-os), that enables commodity hardware to generate a grid of IT capacity. This results into cost-effective, decentralized and highly-secure IT infrastructure, powered by edge computing.

**Self-Healing Awareness** controls and operates the distributed edge cloud and reserves, procures and executes workloads on the grid using [Jumpscale](https://github.com/Jumpscale). It drives self-healing and autoscaling capacity pools for any kind of IT workload.

**Blockchain Technology** protects identity and access control with [itsyou.online](https://github.com/itsyouonline), but also distributes our [Threefold Tokens](http://www.threefoldtoken.com/) to execute smart contracts on top of our own secure and scalable ledger, [Rivine](https://github.com/rivine/rivine).

These three connecting elements are the foundation of a pervasive, neutral, private and affordable Internet that operates and delivers without any central governing body or large corporate company.
