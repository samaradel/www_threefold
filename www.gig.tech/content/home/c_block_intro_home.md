> Yesterday
> The Internet started as global network comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks, it operates without a central governing body. It started with universities, research institutions and government bodies agreeing to collaborate on projects, sharing information, and has now reached the homes of all of us in the developped world.

>> Today
>> The Internet has created a global share and collaboration platform for business and personal use. But 80% of all of the global internet capacity is created and consumed by xx % of the global population concentrated in and around the US, Europe and some Asian countries.  Also it is no longer operating without a central governing body as large multinational organisations now control and dominate.

>>> Tomorrow
>>> GIG aspires to change all of this by creating and distributing technology that provides neutral, private and secure internet capacity for everyone in the world.  This capacity is generated near actual endusers in a very efficient manner using standard of the shelf hardware and open-source software.

### How is GIG going to realize that? ###

GIG creates technology supporting three main streams of innovation

- **Stateless Computing:** a stateless operating system enabling distributed hardware to form a grid of capacity that fuels the neutral, private and secure internet.
- **Artificial Intelligence** controls and operates the distributed capacity and reserves, procures, distributes and actuates workloads on the grid capacity created by zero-os. It creates an autoscaling and self-healing capacity pools for any kind of IT workload.
- **Blockchain Technology** and identity management for all users to have supplier independent authentication and authorisation means by using a scalable distributed ledger.

These three elements are the foundation of a pervasive, neutral, private and affordable internet that operates and delivers withough a central governing body.
