**Yesterday**
The Internet started as global network comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operated without a central governing body. Universities, research institutions and governments agreed to collaborate on projects and share information.

**Today**
The Internet reaches to billions of people and serves as global sharing and collaborative platform for business and personal use. But 80% of all of the global internet capacity is created and consumed by xx % of the global population concentrated in and around the US, Europe and some Asian countries.  Also it is no longer operating without a central governing body as large multinational organisations now control and dominate.

**Tomorrow**
GIG aspires to change all of this by creating and distributing technology that provides neutral, private and secure internet capacity for everyone in the world.  This capacity is generated near actual endusers in a very efficient manner using standard of the shelf hardware and open-source software.
