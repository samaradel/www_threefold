GIG is a tech company that powers a secure, scalable and self-healing Internet. We were formed by a diverse group of like-minded entrepreneurs and engineers chasing the same dream: deliver a truly green and neutral Internet using open-source software.

In the recent years GIG found many disruptors in the market. We work with a variety of partners that dare to be different and break with traditional IT models. The dream to build a new Internet for 100 millions of users with 100 thousands of edge nodes is happening. But we still need to connect a lot of dots!
