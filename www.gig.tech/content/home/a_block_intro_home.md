GIG is a technology company that powers a secure, scalable and self-healing Internet. We were formed by a diverse group of like-minded entrepreneurs and engineers chasing a single goal: building a green and neutral Internet with open-source technology. 

We seek different channels to market and operate a flexible dual-license strategy. This allows us to enable both commercial partners with technology integration and professional services, while nonprofit organisations can freely use our open-source software.
