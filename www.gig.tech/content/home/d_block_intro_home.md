###Terminology###
##Stateless Computing##
To create pervasive distributed capacity is not viable by using bulky statefull host operating systems.  We need a minimal operating system with zero local footprint for file or state storage.  ZERO-OS is a stateless minimal Operating System, container enabled, securely booted from a central hub.


##Artificial Intelligence##
Orchestrating pervasive distributed capacity cannot be done by humans.  Efficient operations requires actors and software robots to automate maintenance and operational tasks.  At You Service implements a framework for artificial intelligence for managing distributed IT workloads.

##Blockchain Technology##
Private and neutral pervasive, distributed capacity requires a different approach for Identity Management. End user information should be controlled by endusers instead of being stored and controlled in a central database.  Blockchain technology makes this a reality.
