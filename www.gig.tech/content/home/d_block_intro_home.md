### How is GIG going to realize that? ###

##Stateless Computing##
To create pervasive distributed capacity is not viable by using bulky statefull host operating systems.  We need a minimal operating system with zero local footprint for file or state storage.  ZERO-OS is a stateless minimal Operating System, container enabled, securely booted from a central hub.

##Artificial Intelligence##
Orchestrating pervasive distributed capacity cannot be done by humans.  Efficient operations requires actors and software robots to automate maintenance and operational tasks.  At You Service implements a framework for artificial intelligence for managing distributed IT workloads.

##Blockchain Technology##
Private and neutral pervasive, distributed capacity requires a different approach for Identity Management. End user information should be controlled by endusers instead of being stored and controlled in a central database.  Blockchain technology makes this a reality.

GIG creates technology supporting three main streams of innovation

- **Stateless Computing:** a stateless operating system enabling distributed hardware to form a grid of capacity that fuels the neutral, private and secure internet.
- **Artificial Intelligence** controls and operates the distributed capacity and reserves, procures, distributes and actuates workloads on the grid capacity created by zero-os. It creates an autoscaling and self-healing capacity pools for any kind of IT workload.
- **Blockchain Technology** and identity management for all users to have supplier independent authentication and authorisation means by using a scalable distributed ledger.

These three elements are the foundation of a pervasive, neutral, private and affordable internet that operates and delivers withough a central governing body.
