### The bigger picture ###

The Internet is a global network comprising many voluntarily (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)[interconnected autonomous networks, it operates without a central governing body]  It started with universities, research institutions and government bodies agreeing to collaborate on projects, sharing information, and has now reached the home of all of us in the developped (western) world.  The internet has created a global share and collaboration platform for business and personal use. But 80% of all of the global internet capacity is created and consumed by xx % of the global population concentrated in and around the US, Europe and some of the Asian countries.  Also it is no longer operating without a central govnerning body as  large multinational organisations now control and dominate.

GIG.tech aspires to change this by creating and distributing technology that provides neutral, private and secure internet capacity for _everyone_ in the world.  This capacity is generated near actual endusers in a very efficient manner using standard (hardware) and opensource software where possible.

GIG.tech  creates technology supporting three main streams of innovation
- zero-os.  A stateless  operating system enabling distributed hardware to form a grid if capacity that drives the neutral, private and secure internet.
- Artificial Intelligence that controles and operates the distributed capacity and reserves, procures, distributes and actuates workloads on the grid capacity created by zero-os
- Identity Management for all users to have supplier independent authentication and authorisation means by using a decentralised data store based on blockchain technology.
