Together with our partners we are building a green and neutral Internet for 100 million users and 100 thousands of edge nodes. Our open-source tech addresses all scalability, security, storage, energy and operating issues and NO need for 3rd party software.

> Stateless Computing: Software to run applications as close as possible to its end-users
> > Artificial Intelligence: Intellgent agents taking care of your total IT infrastructure
> > > Blockchain Technologies: Distributed systems that generate a neutral and secure Internet


- **Stateless Computing:** a stateless operating system enabling distributed hardware to form an Internet grid of IT capacity that fuels the neutral, private and secure Internet.
- **Artificial Intelligence** controls and operates the distributed capacity and reserves, procures, distributes and actuates workloads on the grid capacity created by zero-os. It creates an autoscaling and self-healing capacity pools for any kind of IT workload.
- **Blockchain Technology** and identity management for all users to have supplier independent authentication and authorisation means by using a scalable distributed ledger.

These three elements are the foundation of a pervasive, neutral, private and affordable internet that operates and delivers withough a central governing body.
