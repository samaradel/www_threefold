Together with our partners we dare to be different and break with traditional technology approaches to build IT platforms. The old IT school is to complex and to realise the next Internet for 100 million users using 100 thousands of edge nodes. Our open-source tech addresses all scalability, security, storage, energy and operating issues without the need for any 3rd party software.

> Stateless Computing: Software to run applications as close as possible to its end-users, also called edge computing or edge cloud.

> > Artificial Intelligence: Intellgent agents taking care of your total IT infrastructure making it autoscaling and self-healing.

> > > Blockchain Technologies: Distributed systems to generate a neutral and secure Internet using tokens and smart contracts.


- **Stateless Computing:** a stateless operating system, Zero-OS, enabling distributed hardware to form an Internet grid of IT capacity that fuels a cost-effective, neutral and secure Internet of the future.
- **Artificial Intelligence** controls and operates the distributed capacity and reserves, procures, distributes and actuates workloads on the grid capacity created using Jumpscale. It generates autoscaling and self-healing capacity pools for any kind of IT workload.
- **Blockchain Technology** used for identity management, itsyou.online, but also to distribute tokens and execute smart contract, Threefold Token, and provides an independent and scalable distributed ledger, Rivine, for the sake of transparency to users and operators.

These three elements are the foundation of a pervasive, neutral, private and affordable internet that operates and delivers withough a central governing body.
