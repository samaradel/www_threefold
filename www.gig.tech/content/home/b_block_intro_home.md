Together with our partners we are building a green and neutral Internet for 100 million users and 100 thousands of edge nodes. Our open-source tech addresses all scalability, security, storage, energy and operating issues and NO need for 3rd party software.

> Stateless Computing: Software to run applications as close as possible to its end-users

>> Artificial Intelligence: Intellgent agents taking care of your total IT infrastructure

>>>Blockchain Technologies: Distributed systems that generate a neutral and secure Internet

These three domains of technology development are the foundation for a secure, neutral, scalable and affordable Internet:

- **Stateless Computing:** a stateless operating system enabling distributed hardware to form an Internet grid of IT capacity that fuels the neutral, private and secure Internet with storage and compute power.
- **Artificial Intelligence** controls and operates the distributed capacity and reserves, procures, prepares and executes application workloads with autoscaling and self-healing functions for availability.
- **Blockchain Technology** and new algorithms to reach consensus enable a real-time recording of all activity and changes to a distributed network of systems.
