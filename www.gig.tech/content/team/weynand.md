Rocket scientist that decided slignshotting new IT technologies into customer centric orbits is far more interesting than space technology.  Weyannd is one of the first followers of GIG.tech and has been working for two decades in large multinational organizations building some of the first Internet services in Europe.

I believe that the IT industry needs a fundamental makeover and a radically different approach. Technology should no longer be complex, it should be simple and straightforward way to use IT industry whoever this requires a fundamental change in the Economics of the industry. Weynand is currently Head of Solution Design at GIG Technology.
